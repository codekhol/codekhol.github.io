NEW FEATURES AND CHANGES FOR SFT III v4.1:
(Details on each of the new features are also in the 4.1
documentation)

1 - DEFAULT MEMORY AMOUNT ASSIGNED TO IOENGINE IS NOW 5MB
The default IOEngine size in 3.11 was 2MB, and many customers
were having to increase it via the SET parameters anyway.  5MB
should be a good starting point for SFT III 4.1, for a
small-to-medium-size system.  The 4.1 INSTALL program actually
tries to adjust the IOEngine size automatically, within certain
limits, so that it ends up taking about 25% of the total RAM.

NOTE1: If adjusting the IOEngine size via the SET parameters, be
sure to put these commands near the beginning of the IOSTART.NCF,
right after the IOEngine name and number. 

NOTE2: You can still adjust the IOEngine/MSEngine size by using
the SET parameters (New Start/End Address for Unclaimed Memory
Block).  You may notice, when you specify a new start/end address
with these SET parameters, that the OS will round your value up
to the nearest 4K boundary.  This change was necessary to comply
with 4.1 memory handling.


2 - .NCF CHANGES IN SFT III 4.1
The sequence of execution of these files is the same as in 3.11,
but there are some changes to what goes where in these files.  

Also, in 3.11 the IOAUTO.NCF was not executed the first time the
servers are brought up, the first time ACTIVATE SERVER is typed
at the console.  That has changed for 4.1 SFT III, in that the
IOAUTO is executed now even the first time the servers come up. 
Additional notes below.

You can use INSTALL to view and edit these files once the server
is up and active; in SFT III 4.1 you can cut and paste between
these files.  You'll want to at least take LAN driver load
statements from the IOSTART and put them in the IOAUTO, and move
the LAN drivers from the DOS partition to the SYS volume.

IOSTART (still executed first when you type MSERVER) IOEngine
name and number, SET parameters (do the ones for adjusting memory
assignment first), load disk driver(s), load MSL driver (last in
this file)

MSSTART (executed when you type ACTIVATE SERVER) SET parameters
as needed, those that must be set at startup

MSAUTO  MSEngine name and number, SET parameters, mount commands
for volumes, load any NLMs that run in the MSEngine here

IOAUTO (always executes, even 1st time server is activated*) Load
LAN drivers here, from the SYS volume.  Load any NLMs that need
to be in the IOEngine but need an active MSEngine (and mounted
volume) to load.

*NOTE: If there is something "pending" on the console of the
IOEngine that's "coming back in" after a failure/restart (like
keyboard input without the <Enter>, or a LAN driver load command
waiting for parameters to be specified), the IOAUTO won't execute
until the IOEngine console is "free" or available.  

INETCONFIG NOTE: The INetConfig utility modifies the SFT III
.NCFs correctly, but puts LAN driver load commands into a
separate file (INIT.SYS) that is called from the IOAUTO.NCF.  It
is also ok to have these commands (to load and bind LAN drivers)
directly in the IOAUTO.  Do not try to modify the INIT.SYS file
created by INetConfig, or you will be punished by the system. 
(See item 17 below)


3 - SCREEN BEHAVES A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY WHEN SERVERS ARE COMING
UP 
When the server is activated, after MSSTART (if any) and MSAUTO
are executed, the console screens will switch back to their
respective IOEngines.


4 - TEST MODE DEFAULT (TIME BETWEEN FAILURES) CHANGED
Test Mode default frequency (Server Test Minimum Delay Amount) is
set at 3 minutes between failures now, instead of instantaneous
back-to- back failures.  This provides a more realistic but still
very rigorous test environment.

NOTE that some of the names of the SET parameters for Recovery
Options have changed, so if you're using NORST or a similar NCF
file to set these to zero for debugging purposes, you'll have to
make some changes to the wording of some of the parameters.  (See
name changes, all listed below.)


5 - SET PARAMETER NAME CHANGES
For consistency (especially), clarity and international enabling
(and in response to requests from Beta testers and customers),
the following SET parameters are named differently in 4.1 than in
3.11.  (Same default settings and ranges, see 3.11 or 4.1 doc for
details.)

- MSL Error Wait Time 
   (WAS: Mirrored Server Comm ACK Wait Time Out)
- Secondary Take Over Wait Time 
   (WAS: Secondary Take Over Delay Amount)

   (WAS: Notify Users of Mirrored Server Synchronization)
- Server Failure Notification Name 
   (WAS: Notify Users of Mirrored Server Failures,
    SEE ITEM 7 BELOW)

        
6 - LIMIT SIZE OF LOG FILES (VIA SET PARAMETERS)
Status Dump File Overflow Size = (size in bytes) max size for
MSSTATUS.DMP file before taking action (see below)

Status Dump File State = (0, 1, or 2)
        0: take no action if file exceeds overflow size
        1: (default) delete log file if it exceeds overflow size
        2: rename log file if it exceeds overflow size
        (renames file to MSSTATUS.000, then .001, .002, etc.)

IOEngine Error Log File Overflow Size = (size in bytes) max size
for IO$LOG.ERR file before taking action (see below)

IOEngine Error Log File State = (0, 1, or 2)
        0: take no action if file exceeds overflow size
        1: (default) delete log file if it exceeds overflow size
        2: rename log file if it exceeds overflow size
        (renames file to IO$LOG.000, then .001, .002, etc.)


7 - GROUP/USER NOTIFICATION UPON SERVER FAILURE
Instead of broadcasting to every attached user when a server
failure occurs, the SFT III 4.1 OS will use the group or username
specified via the new SET parameter below, and broadcast only to
that group or user. 

(Set in the MSEngine):
SET SERVER FAILURE NOTIFICATION NAME = GROUP_NAME

The broadcast goes to the specified user or any members of the
specified group that are attached when the failure occurs.  The
error messages about switchover reason, etc. still go to the
console and log files.

IMPORTANT ENHANCEMENT: In addition to server failures that result
in a switchover to the new primary, this broadcast will also
occur when a disk drive fails for any reason.  Same user or group
will be notified as described above.  In addition, a message is
printed to the server console (but not broadcast) every 30
minutes to the effect that a disk failure has occurred and
mirroring is no longer active.  (This is in case the disk failure
happened at a time when no one was logged in.  The console and
log files will still show these messages.)

The other broadcast message option acts the same as in 3.11, and
is to notify users of the short delay they may experience during
synchronization when the failed server is coming back up.  The
wording on this parameter changed slightly from 3.11:  

SET NOTIFY ALL USERS OF MIRRORED SERVER SYNCHRONIZATION = ON


8 - ALTERNATE/BACKUP MSL FEATURE
SFT III 4.1 allows for the use of more than one MSL per server. 
At any given time, when the server is active, only 1 MSL is being
used, and any others are in a "standby" mode in case the active
MSL fails.

The CONFIG command at the IOEngine console will show the status
of any MSLs that are loaded.  (Active, Standby, etc.)

The MSLs should be loaded in order of preference, at the end of
the IOAUTO.NCF; the first-loaded MSL will always be used unless
it continues to fail.  Any additional MSLs are loaded then
monitored uring normal operation to make sure they are ready to
take over if the active one fails.  (There is essentially no
overhead involved in this monitoring; no measurable performance
hit.)  If one of the standby MSLs fails, a message is sent to the
console (and log file).  If the active or MSL fails, the
secondary server restarts (as is the case with any MSL failures),
and when it comes back up the OS will re-load and re-try the
preferred (first-loaded) MSL then the second, etc. until a
functional MSL is found.  Synchronization can only occur after a
functional MSL is loaded, and this will happen automatically. 
(When the secondary server restarts because of MSL failure, the
broadcast message described above will go out to the user or
group specified.)

SFT III 4.1 allows for a maximum of 8 MSLs per server (although
any more than 2 or 3 seems like overkill).  Each MSL must be
cabled properly for automatic takeover; the standby MSL cannot be
used as a LAN card.


9 - INSTALL FOR SFT III V4.1 IS IMPROVED
The SFT III Install procedure has changed significantly from the
3.11 version.  The documentation covers paths to install SFT III
from scratch ("Initial Installation"), as well as an option to
"Convert" a server from SFT III 3.11 to SFT III 4.1, and an
option to "Upgrade" regular NetWare 4.1 to SFT III (4.1).  See
the SFT III 4.1 document for details on each of these paths.

INITIAL INSTALLATION
Since SFT III is treated as an add-on or upgrade from "regular"
NetWare, the Install program will first take you through a normal
NetWare 4.1 installation on the initial server before getting to
the SFT III-specific part.  You will be prompted for far less
stuff than you were in 3.11; as much of the process as possible
has been automated.  For example, the server name you provide
(JOE for example) will be used for the MSEngine, and will then
generate IOEngine names JOE_IO1 and JOE_IO2 automatically.  The
install from scratch begins with a DOS front-end program
(INSTALL.BAT) which prompts you through everything, including MSL
and selection and activation, the creation of 3 floppies with the
minimal file set needed for the second server, and then
automatically goes into INSTALL.NLM when the server is activated.

CONVERT 3.11 SFT III to 4.1 SFT III
Preserves and re-uses all partition information, engine
names/numbers, etc. and automatically moves the LAN and disk
driver LOAD commands to their recommended locations in the new
.NCF file scheme.  (See item 2 above)

UPGRADE NETWARE 4.1 to SFT III
Identical to the procedure for initial install, without the
procedure of installing regular NetWare 4.1 on the initial server
first.  Nothing needs to be set up on the second server, since
the Install program will set up partitions and mirroring
automatically, and even make adjustments to memory alignment if
necessary.  

IN EVERY CASE, YOU WILL EVENTUALLY BE PROMPTED FOR THE SECOND,
ADDITIONAL LICENSE DISKETTE FOR SFT III.  YOU MUST HAVE -BOTH- A
LICENSE DISKETTE FOR REGULAR 4.1 AND A LICENSE DISKETTE FOR SFT
III.  The 4.1 license is the one that determines the user count;
the SFT III license is an upgrade for any user count to the same
on mirrored servers.  Same SFT III license for 5-user NetWare as
for 1000-user NetWare.


10 - MAC/TCP SUPPORT
Name spaces load in the MSEngine See separate sheets [Supplements
1 and 2, included at the end of this document] for TCP/IP FOR SFT
III and APPLETALK ZONE NAMES AND NUMBERS.


11 - DS AND TIMESYNC
DS runs in the MSEngine, runs just like in 4.1.  DSLOADER and DS
are separate NLMs.  The Directory is now unloadable (new in 4.1).
The DS Install is the same as for normal 4.1, except that on an
SFT III server there is no requirement to pre-load LAN drivers.

TimeSync loads in the MSEngine, but the time stuff can be set in
any of the 3 engines, and will be propagated to the other two
engines. NOTE: Set time/zone in any engine, and time will by
synchronized in the other two engines.  Don't set time or zone in
both IOEngines simultaneously; also set begin and end of Daylight
Savings time in the same engine.


12 - MEMORY PROTECTION (DOMAIN.NLM)
Loads in MSEngine and/or both IOEngines.  As in 4.0, DOMAIN must
be loaded first, and cannot be  unloaded.  Works correctly in
dual-processor SFT III.

NOTE: In case you have used early Alpha code for SFT III 4.1, be
aware of the following change: There is no longer an IOEngine
piece required for DOMAIN.NLM in the MSEngine.


13 - PRINT CHANGES
PSERVER loads in the MSEngine NPRINTER loads in either or both
IOEngines, or (recommended) on a separate machine.  Jobs in
progress continue through a server failure.


14 - BTRIEVE CHANGES
Use Btrieve v6.1C or later for SFT III 3.11. For SFT III 4.1:
BRouter and BSPX.COM in IOEngine, Btrieve in MSEngine
Accommodates ArcServe 5.0, XQL, SQL, INetConfig, Product Install,
and other Btrieve-dependent modules.


15 - NLM CONNECTION PROBLEM RESOLVED
NLMs in 3.11 used up "real" user connections; this has been fixed
in the 4.1 product.  You will see NLM connections show up not as
SUPERVISOR connections, but as a user called [ServerName] (which
will be the MSEngine name).  This user will not "count" against
the maximum user connections limit.

NOTE: All registered 3.11 SFT III users will get 4.1 SFT III for
free.  This is an important promotion good until the end of the
1994 calendar year.  Customers will receive the user count they
originally purchased under SFT III 3.11, since this connection
problem has been resolved.


16 - DUAL PROCESSOR DRIVERS W/SFT III ALPHA AND BETA CODE
Dual processor drivers written for SFT III v3.11 will also work
with SFT III 4.1.  Customers should be able to use existing 3.11
DP drivers with the 4.1 SFT III OS.  (Compaq has updated their
SFT III DP driver CPQMP.NLM for SFT III 4.1.)  As in 3.11, DP
drivers can be loaded or unloaded at any time, in either or both
IOEngines, and the MSEngine code will be assigned to the second
processor in that box.


17 - INETCONFIG UTILITY
The new INetConfig utility automates the updating of .NCF
information, but does so by maintaining separate files that are
called from the normal .NCFs.  If you use INetConfig, you will
notice a new line in the MSAUTO.NCF and IOAUTO.NCF calling the
separate file for INetConfig.  It's called INITSYS.NCF and must
-not- be edited by hand; only using INetConfig.  The location of
this file on an SFT III server is as follows:

-for the MSEngine (JOE): SYS:\ETC\INITSYS.NCF
-for the first IOEngine (JOE_IO1): SYS:\ETC\IO1\INITSYS.NCF
-for the second IOEngine (JOE_IO2): SYS:\ETC\IO2\INITSYS.NCF


18 - NEW DEFAULTS FOR PACKET RECEIVE BUFFERS
Minimum and maximum packet receive buffers (SET parameters in all
3 engines) have higher defaults in SFT III than in regular 4.1
(100/400 in SFT III, 50/100 in regular 4.1) to maximize
efficiency and speed during synchronization.

NOTE: If you change either the min or max packet receive buffers,
it's best if you make those values the same in all 3 engines
(primary/secondary IOEngines, MSEngine).


19 - MSL CERTIFICATION LIST
See attached list (from IMSP/Novell Labs) (Supplement 3 at the
end of this document) of MSL drivers that have been certified and
are included on the NetWare 4.1 CD.  The hardware certification
bulletins for a given machine include information about SFT III
if they have been tested with the SFT III OS.  This information
includes which MSL card they were tested with.


20 - MEMSCAN.NLM
This is a utility that forces a read through memory (1K chunks at
a time) every -n- seconds, then starts over.  The goal is to
discover parity errors (NMIs) during normal server operation,
instead of during server synchronization.  This is just a test
utility and is NOT delivered as part of the product.  A couple of
customers have used it to narrow down memory errors, but Novell
does not intend to productize it or make it generally available.


21 - MIRROR STATUS NOTES
"Out of sync" normally means that mirroring is set up but one of
the machines isn't there (or the disk driver is not loaded, etc.)

"Not fully mirrored" normally means that mirroring has been
broken, and needs to be set up again using INSTALL.


22 - ORACLE 7 AND SFT III
The shipping 4.1 SFT III when used with Oracle 7 may produce an
abend on both servers (MSEngines produced different outputs). 
This is fixed with a new CLIB.NLM (v4.1B, dated 11/30/94 or
later, available on NetWire) and an OS patch which is also
available on NetWire by the time 4.1 ships.


23 - CHEYENNE ARCSERVE AND SFT III
ArcServe may not be able to make the connection necessary to back
up a remote server from an SFT III 4.1 server.  This is fixed
with a new CLIB.NLM (v4.1B, dated 11/30/94 or later, available on
NetWire).


24 - COMPAQ INSIGHT MANAGER AND SERVER MANAGER BOARDS
To run correctly on an SFT III server, these products require
never versions of the DAI shims than what are shipping on the 4.1
CD.  MSDAI40.NLM (v2.00B) and IODAI40.NLM (v2.00C) are available
on NetWire.  If a customer uses the 4.1 CD versions of these
NLMs, they will load but may not run correctly.  The DAI NLMs may
not unload without abending the server.  This is what's fixed
with these newer versions of the DAI NLMs.


25 - UPGRADE PROMOTION FROM 3.11 SFT III TO 4.1 SFT III
Any registered user of SFT III v3.11 will receive the new 4.1 SFT
III at no charge.  All SFT III 3.11 users should register and
take advantage of this upgrade opportunity.  Novell has no plans
to further enhance the SFT III 3.x product; all enhancements will
be added on the 4.x platform.


26 - REMIRROR BLOCK SIZE, MIRRORING ABORTS AT 99%
If a customer has increased the remirror block size from the
default of 4K, and if the NetWare partition being mirrored is of
a size not evenly divisible by that new size, they will notice
that mirroring aborts at 99%.  This can be resolved by simply
SETting the "remirror block size" parameter back down to 4K. 
(Mirroring will then complete, just that last chunk; it will not
have to remirror the whole partition again.)

SUPPLEMENT 1 - TCP/IP FOR SFTIII

NOTE: This is intended for those who already know a little about
TCP/IP configuration.

Because TCP/IP uses the Ethernet_II frame type, it is important
that this frame type be loaded in each IOEngine; no protocol need
be bound to this frame type until you have loaded all other
supporting NLM's in each IOEngine.  Some of these support NLMs
include SNMP, TLI, CLIB, STREAMS, and IPXS.  Loading TCP/IP
should auto load all the appropriate support NLMs.

You should take time before hand to determine IP addresses to use
for the IOEngines, IOEngine-MSEngine internal route, and the
MSEngine unless these have been supplied by your network
administrator.  You will need four addresses.  The addresses for
the IOEngines should be associated with the same (sub)network. 
The IOEngine-MSEngine internal route and the MSEngine IP
addresses should be on another (sub)network from the IOEngines,
as they will route for the MSEngine (Server).  This is commonly
done with you network masks.
        
SUB-NETWORK MASKS

example IP address: 130.57.30.56

MASK              NETWORK           SUBNET            NODE
Default           130.57.                             30.56
255.255.255.0     130.57.           30.               56
255.255.240.0*    130.57.           16.               14.56

*
240 = 1111  0000
30  = 0001  1110
      16    14

Therefore the subnet for the last example in the table is 16 and
the host node becomes 14.56.  This is because the 16 bit of 30 is
masked by 240. The remaining bits (binary positions 8, 4, 2, and
1) leave 14 as part of the host node.

In order for you to have all servers on the same (sub)network,
you might consider using stub-sub-network mask for the internal
IOEngine-MSEngine route and MSEngine IP addresses.

If you are a class B network with existing sub networks, you will
have to use a stub-sub-network mask to have all SFTIII servers on
the same sub-network.

(examples follow)

For example, if you were assigned the class B network of 141.51,
and your area is on subnet 32, all addresses would begin
141.51.32.  In addition, all masks would have to be
255.255.255.0, in order for routing to work correctly.  In order
for you to get your SFTIII Server (MSEngine) on different
networks from 141.51.32.xx you would have to use stub-sub-network
masks as the following outline shows.

Given IOEngine addresses of
Primary_IO        =141.51.32.5      Mask=255.255.255.0
Secondary_IO      =141.51.32.6      Mask=255.255.255.0
MSEngine          =141.51.32.18     Mask=255.255.255.240
Internal          =141.51.32.17     Mask=255.255.255.0

Because the mask is the same for the first three digits, these
all become part of the network address (141.51.32.).  All that
remains for the IOEngines is the host node address; 5 and 6 for
the primary and secondary engines. The internal
(IOEngine-MSEngine route) address is 17, and on the same network
as the IOEngines.  As you can see, the MSEngine is
stub-sub-networked by the additional mask of 240.  This forces
the MSEngine (SFTIII Server) to be on another network from the
IOEngines (141.51.32.16 host node 2).  You will also note that
the IOEngine-MSEngine route address was chosen so that it could
be placed on the same stub-sub-net as the MSEngine (141.51.32.16

It is important to note that no Clients/Hosts can have addresses
in the stub-sub-net mask address range (in this case 141.51.32.16
to 141.51.32.31), as routing implies that these clients/hosts are
on the same 'wire' as the MSEngine and this is physically
impossible.  With careful thought and planning, TCP/IP can be
successfully implemented on SFTIII.

SUPPLEMENT 2 - APPLETALK ZONE NAMES AND NUMBERS


APPLETALK ZONE NAMES:

Zone names are 1 to 32 characters, case sensitive, allows spaces
and include all printable characters except * and ".

NETWORK/ZONE NUMBERS.

NUMBER  MEANING
0       Non seed interface for non extended network
X       Seeded interface for non extended network, X must be
        in the range of 1 to 65279 inclusive.

0 - 0   Non seed interface for extended network
X - Y   Seeded interface for extended network, X and Y must be 
        in the range of 1 to 65279 inclusive and Y must be equal
        or greater than X.

NON EXTENDED APPLETALK NETWORKS:
- LocalTalk
- Arcnet
- Ethernet with frame type ETHERNET_II

EXTENDED APPLETALK NETWORKS:
- TokenRing
- FDDI
- Ethernet with frame type ETHERNET_SNAP
- SFT3 virtual board

BINDING APPLETALK TO LAN BOARDS:
LAN board to non seed, extended network
  bind appletlk <BOARD NAME> net = 0-0
  e.g. bind appletlk ne2_snap net = 0-0

LAN board to non seed, non extended network
  bind appletlk <BOARD NAME> net = 0
  e.g. bind appletlk ne2_II net = 0

LAN board to seeded, extended network
  bind appletlk <BOARD NAME> net= X-Y zone={"appletalk zone
  name"}
  e.g. bind appletlk ne2_II net = 12-20 zone={"zone 12 - 20"}
  NOTE: You may specify the same zone name for more than one
  extended networks.

LAN board to seeded, non extended network
  bind appletlk <BOARD NAME> net= X zone={"appletalk zone name"}
  e.g. bind appletlk ne2_II net = 12 zone={"zone 12"}
  NOTE: You must specify a unique zone name for a non extended
  network.

AppleTalk to the virtual board or MSEngine
  bind appletlk MSEngine net= X-X zone={"appletalk zone name"}
  e.g. bind appletlk MSENGINE net = 21-21 zone={"SFT3 zone 21"}
  NOTE: Appletalk is operated as an extended network on the SFT3
  virtual network and the network range is 1.

SUPPLEMENT 4 - NOVELL PRODUCTS AND NETWARE 4.1 SFT III (AS OF
11/94)

Messaging Services (ships with v4.10)
 Supports SFT III: Yes
 Issues/notes: (none)

NetWare for Mac v4.10 (ships with v4.10)
 Supports SFT III: Yes
 Issues/notes: (none)

Global MHS v2.0d
 Supports SFT III: Yes
Issues/notes: Not extensively tested with SFT III, loads and runs
through test suites.  If v2.0d is updated to support NetWare 4.1,
be sure to use the latest version with SFT III as well.  Cannot
run asynchronous support because of hardware constraints.

LAN WorkPlace v4.2
 Supports SFT III: Yes
Issues/notes: TCPIP stack does not include router discovery.  As
a result, if one SFT III side goes down, the client won't switch
automatically to the other side.  You can work around this by
defining a second IP Router in the NET.CFG.

LAN WorkGroup v4.2
 Supports SFT III: Yes
 Issues/notes: Same as above.

NFS v2.0 (beta)
 Supports SFT III: Yes
Issues/notes: XCONSOLE.NLM not supported on SFT III.  Xconsole
needs access to both Remote and DSAPI which run in different
engines.  If you try to load XCONSOLE.NLM in either engine you
will get undefined public symbol error messages. NFS install 
expects you to have a startup.ncf and an autoexec.ncf  because
that is were it puts Unistart.ncf.  You will need to manually put
Unistart.ncf in the MSauto.ncf.

NetWare IP  v1.1
 Supports SFT III: Yes and No
Issues/notes: At this writing (11/94), official support for SFT
III is pending; it can be made to work with the following nuance:
TCPIP stack doesn't include router discovery.  As a result, if
one SFT III side goes down, the client won't switch automatically
to the other side.  You can work around this by defining a second
IP Router in the NET.CFG.

MSS 1.0 (Kodak/Novell Migration product) (beta)
 Supports SFT III: Yes
 Issues/notes: Beta product, extensive testing has not been
completed

NMA v2.0 (alpha)
 Supports SFT III: Yes
 Issues/notes: Alpha product, extensive testing has not been
completed

NMS v2.1 (alpha)
 Supports SFT III: Yes
Issues/notes:  Alpha product, extensive testing has not been
completed

UnixWare v2.0 (NUC.NLM) (beta)
 Supports SFT III: Yes
 Issues/notes: Beta product; extensive testing has not been
completed.

-----------------------------------------------------
NMA v1.6, NMS v2.0c
 Supports SFT III: No (SFT III is supported with NMS v2.1 and NMA
v2.0)

NFS v1.2c
 Supports SFT III: No  (Use NFS v2.0)

NW Connect v1.0, v2.0
 Supports SFT III: No

NW for DEC Access (LAT)
 Supports SFT III: No

NW Navigator v3.0c
 Supports SFT III: No

NW for SAA v1.3b, v2.0
 Supports SFT III: No
Issues/notes: The 3rd internal IPX number causes problems for
Commexec.  SAA has a feature called Hot Standby--another server
can be configured to automatically take over if the first goes
down.  (Terminal emulation software must be specifically written
to support the "rollover feature", however.)  Because of this
feature, it was decided that SFT III support was not urgently
necessary.

Hostprint 1.1
 Supports SFT III: No (depends on SAA)

MPR v3.0 (beta)
 Supports SFT III: No

HAMs & CDMs
 Support SFT III: No
Issues/notes: If you try to use them you will get undefined
public symbol error messages. SFT III users should use the *.DSK
disk drivers instead.
