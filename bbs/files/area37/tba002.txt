Technical Bulletin==================
Title:	         Using Microsoft Access with Btrieve Files
Document ID:     TB.A.0002
Date:	         May 5, 1993
Product:         Btrieve
Product Version: v5.x
Supersedes:	 N/A
Symptom:	 See below.
The Data Dictionary-------------------
Microsoft Access can access (read or modify) a Btrieve file only 
through that file's data dictionary. A data dictionary is a set of
files that define fields for each record of a Btrieve file. To
produce the data dictionary files (DDFs) for a Btrieve file, you must
know the starting offset, length, and type of each portion of a
file's records that corresponds to a field. You can then use NetWare
SQL, Xtrieve PLUS, or a similar product to define the DDFs for that
Btrieve file. Access cannot create DDFs for a Btrieve file.
File Owner Names----------------
Access opens DDFs with the Novell default DDF owner name; therefore,
if security is defined on a set of DDFs, Access cannot read the DDFs.
In this situation, Access returns the error Couldn't Decrypt File.
If a Btrieve file has an owner name, but does not require you to 
specify the name in order to read the file (level 1 or 3), Access
does not prompt you for the owner name. Although Access can read the
data from the file, attempting to edit the file's data causes Access
to return the following error: Couldn't update; database is
read-only.
If a Btrieve file has an owner name, and that file requires that you 
specify the owner name in order to read or modify the file (level 0 
or 2), Access prompts you for the owner name. If you are using 
Btrieve v5.x, Access opens the file for normal use after you specify
the owner name. However, if you are using Btrieve v6.x, Access cannot
open the file even after you specify the owner name. Instead, Access
returns the error Couldn't Decrypt File. This error occurs because
Btrieve v6.x requires that the data buffer length be set to the
length of the owner name plus the null terminator on an Open
operation. Access sets the data buffer length only to the length of
the owner name.
Tables and the Btrieve File Format----------------------------------
Access can create a Btrieve file and define it to a set of DDFs that 
have been previously defined by Xtrieve PLUS, NetWare SQL, or a 
similar application. Access refers to this action as exporting a
table in Btrieve format.
When exporting a table in Btrieve format, Access always adds the 
4-byte integer field 'M_I_C_R_O_S_O_F_T' as the first field of the 
table. Access also makes this field the only index in the table.
Access translates its own data types into specific Btrieve data types
when it exports a table in Btrieve format. The following list shows 
the data types that result when Access exports data to a Btrieve DDF 
file. 
           Access Data Type          DDF Data Type
           ================          =============
           Text                      string
           Number                    float
           Date/Time                 date
           Currency                  money
           Counter                   integer
           Yes/No                    logical
           Memo                      note
           OLE Object                lvar
You can use Access to read a Btrieve file's format from one set of 
DDFs and then export the table for that Btrieve file to another set
of DDFs. You can also use Access to join, query, or update the tables
for Btrieve files that are defined in different sets of DDFs. 
Access allows you to join Btrieve-based tables to tables that use 
other formats (such as Access, Paradox, or dBASE IV). However, you 
cannot export the data from such a joined view or restricted query to
a Btrieve file. You can export only single unrestricted tables to 
Btrieve format.
Transaction Processing----------------------
Access operations occur mainly inside transactions; therefore, you 
must configure Btrieve for transaction processing.
Btrieve for Windows-------------------
WBTRCALL.DLL, the Btrieve for Windows DLL, is no longer packaged with
Access. You can purchase this DLL from Novell in the Btrieve for
Windows Developer's Kit.
The Requester version of this DLL is available from CompuServe in the
NOVLIB forum, in Lib7, in the file BTRREQ.ZIP. You can use this 
Requester with Access to access Btrieve files that reside on a 
NetWare v2.x, v3.x, or v4.0 server running the Btrieve engine. For 
information about how to install the Btrieve engine packaged with 
your version of NetWare, see the Btrieve Installation and Operation 
manual included in the NetWare documentation.
Access returns error -5001 if you are using the Btrieve v6.x
Requester and WBTRVRES.DLL is not available in your path. Access also
returns error -5001 whenever it receives a Btrieve status code that
it has not been programmed to handle. Most of these Btrieve status
codes are greater than 90.
Access can also return the error Disk or Network Error.  This error
occurs if Access tries to read a Btrieve file's associated DDFs using
a pre-v6.x version of WBTRCALL.DLL, but the DDFs have been created by
Xtrieve PLUS, NetWare SQL, or other application that used Btrieve
v6.x to create those DDFs. This error resembles Btrieve Status Code
2, which Btrieve returns when an application attempts to access a
v6.x-formatted file with a client (v5.x) engine. To solve this
problem, either run the Btrieve v6.x NLM with the v6.x version of
BREQUEST or WBTRCALL.DLL, or make sure that all files accessed with
the client WBTRCALL.DLL are stored in v5.x format.
