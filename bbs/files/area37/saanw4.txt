How to install NetWare for SAA 1.3A on NetWare 4.0

A. Bindery Emulation
--------------------
Bindery Emulation must be enabled on the NetWare 4.0 server on which
NetWare for SAA 1.3 installed.  The SET BINDERY CONTEXT command in
AUTOEXEC.NCF or STARTUP.NCF enables bindery emulation.  In addition, the
NetWare 4.0 server must have a READ/WRITE, or master replica of its
partition, in order for bindery emulation to be enabled.  Please refer to
the NetWare 4.0 System Administration Guide.
  
CAUTION: Do not change the Bindery Context (Bindery Emulation) once NetWare
for SAA 1.3 is installed.  Doing so will require you to reinstall NetWare
for SAA 1.3 again.

B. Sample AUTOEXEC.NCF for NetWare 4.0
--------------------------------------
In this sample AUTOEXEC.NCF for a NetWare 4.0 installation, the same
adapter card is used for both LAN and host access.  Lowercase indicates
items that you must fill in with your own values (for the bindery context
and the file server name and the IPX internal network number.)
  SET BINDERY CONTEXT = bindery_context
  FILE SERVER NAME file_server_name
  IPX INTERNAL NET internal_network_number
  LOAD CLIB
  LOAD BTRIEVE -U=1 -P=4096 -F=20 -H=60 -L=20 -C
  SET MAXIMUM PACKET RECEIVE BUFFERS=2000
  ; LAN CONNECTION:
  LOAD NE2000 INT=3 PORT=300 FRAME=ETHERNET_802.3
  ; HOST CONNECTION:
  LOAD NE2000 INT=3 PORT=300 FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2 NAME= xxxx
  ; where xxxx is the Logical Adapter Name from CSCON              

C. NetWare for SAA Installation 
-------------------------------
Do not install SNMP, since it is already present on the system.  The
procedure below assumes you have already followed the instructions on the
SAA 1.3A "Quick Install Card" for XCOPYing the product files to a NetWare
partition on the NetWare 4.0 server.
To install the Communication Executive update, issue the following commands
at the NetWare console:
  1.  Type LOAD INSTALL <Enter>.
  2.  Select Maintenance/Selective Install <Enter>.
  3.  Select Product Options <Enter>.
  4.  Press <Insert>.
  5.  Enter the full pathname to the Communication Executive subdirectory
on your SYS: volume, and press <ENTER>. 
      For example:   SYS:CE13
  6.  Select "Install on this server".

Perform a similar operation to install NetWare for SAA:
  1.  Type LOAD INSTALL <Enter>.
  2.  Select Maintenance/Selective Install <Enter>.
  3.  Select Product Options <Enter>.
  4.  Press <Insert>.
  5.  Enter the full pathname to the NetWare for SAA subdirectory on the
SYS: volume, and press <Enter>. 
      For example:   SYS:NWSAA13
  6.  Select "Install on this server".  
  7.  After you have installed the Communication Executive and NetWare for
SAA, down the server and restart it (with the SERVER command).  You must do
this to ensure proper operation of the Communications Server after you have
installed NetWare for SAA.

D. SPECIAL NETWARE 4.0 INFORMATION
----------------------------------
1.  Multiple Communication Executives can now simultaneously exist in the
same NetWare 4.0 Organizational Unit.

2. Create a User for CSCON.  In order for a user to be able to log in to
CSCON and configure the CS under NetWare 4.0
 a. Create a user under the Organizational Unit (context) where SAA has
been installed.  
 b. The user must then be given 'Supervisor Equivalent' rights (in the
NetWare 3.11 sense).  This can be accomplished by making the user's
security equivalent to the File Server object.  
 c. Use the NWADMIN utility running on a workstation to:
 I.    Log in as NetWork Administrator (Admin) to the NetWare 4.0 server.
 II.   Load NWADMIN from Windows. 
 III.  Select the Organizational Unit (context) where SAA is installed.
 IV.   Click on OBJECT from the NetWare Administrator screen.
 V.    Click on CREATE.
 VI.   Select USER from the NEW OBJECT LIST, and click OK.
 VII.  Fill in the user information
     	- login name
        - last name
 VIII. Select the ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES box and click OK.
 IX.   Click on the PASSWORD RESTRICTIONS box on the right of the screen;
 X.    Check the REQUIRE PASSWORD box 
 XI.   Click on the CHANGE PASSWORD bar.  
 XII.  Type the password in both boxes
 XIII. Click OK.
 XIV.  From the same screen, click on the SECURITY EQUIVALENCIES box in the
right lower corner of the screen.
 XV.   Click on the ADD box.
 XVI.  Select the FILE SERVER OBJECT where SAA is installed from the
OBJECTS LIST.  
 XVII. Click OK.
 XVIII.The file server object will now be shown in the SECURITY EQUAL TO
window.  Click OK to exit.

The user just generated will now be able to log in to the server and run
CSCON to configure SAA service profiles.

3.  OS Ring Protection
NetWare for SAA 1.3 can only be loaded and executed in the OS Domain at
Ring 0 under NetWare 4.0.  NetWare for SAA 1.3 cannot exist in the OS
Protected Domain at rings 1, 2, or 3.

4.  Do not create a user called SUPERVISOR in NetWare 4.0.  SUPERVISOR has
a special meaning and is maintained by the NetWare 4.0 operating system for
the purpose of 3.11 compatibility.

5.  You must not change the NetWare 4.0 server's Internal IPX Net number
while NetWare for SAA 1.3 is installed.  If you do, you will be unable to
load COMMEXEC.  To recover, change the Internal IPX Net number back to the
one used when NetWare for SAA 1.3 was first installed.  If you need to
change the number:
 a. Backup the existing service profiles.
 b. Remove NetWare for SAA 1.3.
 c. Change the Internal IPX Net number.
 d. Reboot the server.
 e. Reinstall NetWare for SAA 1.3.

6.  To bind a transport protocol manually, issue the following command at
the NetWare console:
    CSBIND [spx|appletalk|tcp-ip]
To unbind a transport protocol manually, issue the following command at the
NetWare console:
    CSUNBIND [spx|appletalk|tcp-ip]

Under NetWare 4.0, CSUNBIND is the only method of unloading a transport
protocol while workstations are connected to NetWare for SAA.

IMPORTANT 
1.  If you need to remove Directory Services from a server that has NetWare
for SAA installed on it:
 a. Backup the profiles (using SAACOPY),
 b. Remove NWSAA and COMMEXEC from the server.
 c. Remove Directory Services  
 d. Reinstall Directory Services
 e. Reinstall COMMEXEC and NWSAA
 f. Use SAACOPY to copy the profiles back to the server.

2.  If NetWare for SAA is unloaded (CSUNLOAD) and then reloaded immediately
(CSLOAD) while a large number (i.e., approximately 100) of downstream PUs
are connected to it, NetWare for SAA may abend with the error:
         FSM_XID3_NEG_PROTO.

This occurs only if the downstream Pus are also running NetWare for SAA on
a server.

To avoid this problem, wait for about two minutes between unloading and
reloading NetWare for SAA.

3.  Do not put the  CSSTATUS statement immediately after the LOAD COMMEXEC
statement in an AUTOEXEC.NCF file.  You may either issue the CSSTATUS
statement manually, or insert another statement between the CSSTATUS and
the LOAD COMMEXEC.

4. Remote installation from a local server's diskette drive may cause
problems.  If you attempt to do a remote installation and use the local
server's diskette drive to install NWSAA 1.3 the following error message
may appear in certain situations:
        "Error , BuildCDProductsList returned -1
              Press Any Key To Continue".

At this point NWSAA installation fails.  The problem is caused by diskette
drive access slow enough to cause the SPX connection to the remote server
to timeout, in which case the install process can't write to the
PRODUCTS.DAT file.  This also depends on network traffic.  In some
situations this remote install procedure from diskette will work with no
problems.

There are two possible solutions.
 a. Do the remote install from a DOS hard drive or NetWare volume.  
     OR
 b. Increase both the remote and local server's SPX timeout values, "SPX 
WATCHDOG ABORT TIMEOUT" and "SPX ACK WAIT TIMEOUT", using SPXCONFG.NLM.

NMA for NetView (NetView Ready) experiences the same problems as above for
remote installs from diskette drive.

NIC DRIVERS
We recommend the use of ODI drivers, for both the host connection and the
LAN connection.
