NOVELL PRODUCT and VERSION:
NetWare Client for DOS/Windows 

ABSTRACT:

This file contains a README that explains how and why WINUP9.EXE and 
DOSUP9.EXE have been removed and broken into four new files: WINDR2.EXE,
NWDLL2.EXE, VLMUP2.EXE, and NET33X.EXE. Because of the Compuserve limitation
of file names to Octal (6.3) naming, Novell has decided this would be a 
perfect opportunity to end the tradition of DOSUPx.EXE and WINUPx.EXE 
naming schemes for DOS & Windows clients and change to this new format. 
The file contains detailed instructions on which files to download for
your configuration.

SYMPTOM

Which files do I need to download to update my workstations?

SOLUTION

The following is a matrix that identifies which files you need to download
to update you workstation.  When the VLMs are referenced - the assumption
is made that you have already installed the VLMS with with the client kit
that is provided with the NetWare products 4.X and 3.12.  If you are using
NetWare 3.11 or NetWare 2.x and have not already purchased the client kit, 
you can purchase a site license for $99.00 (US dollars) by entering the 
NOVFILES forum \Client Kits\Order DOS/Windows client (v1.2) you will be
asked for a credit card number, or you can call 1-800-UPDATE1 and order the
"NetWare Client for DOS/MS Windows v1.2" - part number 00662644024943.

**   The dynamic link libraries (*.dll) that you need are dependent upon the
     version of NWADMIN.EXE that you run.  If you are using the NWDAMIN.EXE
     that comes with 4.02 (NWADMIN.EXE 5-12-94 v4.06) you will need to use 
     the client files that come with NetWare v4.02.  That client kit contains
     the DLLs that correspond to the 4.06 version of NWADMIN.EXE. The v4.06
     NWADMIN will not run if the workstation has the DLLs from this file
     loaded.


***  The drivers contained in VLMUP2.EXEm WINDR2.EXE, and NWDLL2.EXE are the
     same as the files that ship with NetWare v4.10.  

@    Personal Netware works only with VLMs (you cannot use NETX).

SOLUTION SPECIFICS

DOSUP9.EXE has been divided into 2 files - VLMUP2.EXE and NET33X.EXE. 

  VLMUP2.EXE contains all the updated VLMs (Pre-release v1.20), the updated 
  ODI drivers (LSL.COM and IPXODI.COM), the updated MLIDs, and other 
  associated files.  


  Note: The new naming scheme required the three files be in synch
        on their revision number.
	
		
  NET33X.EXE contains the latest NETX.EXE.  Novell is recommending that
  users upgrade to the ODI/VLMs since NETX.EXE is no longer under development.
  Novell's 16-bit solution is ODI/VLMs rather than NETX.



WINUP9.EXE has been divided into 2 files - WINDR2.EXE and NWDLL2.EXE.

  WINDR2.EXE contains the updated Windows drivers and Vxds that are independent
  of the utilities that you are running (ie. NWADMIN.EXE).  These files are
  used by both NETX and VLM clients with excpetion of NETWARE.DRV.  The 
  NETWARE.DRV for NETX is in NET33X.EXE.  Users running Windows on their w/s
  will want to use the the updated drivers in this file.

  NWDLL2.EXE contains the Netware dynamic link libraries for Windows. 
  Many users will not need to download this file since the dynamic link 
  libraries (*.dll) that you need are dependent upon the version of 
  NWADMIN.EXE that you run (if running NetWare 4.x), and any version 
  from WINUP9 or later is required if running on a 2.x or 3.x server.  
  By breaking WINUP9.EXE into 2 files Novell is saving the customer 
  from having to download 350k of information that they may not need. 

  At times it has become necessary for Novell to update some client modules but
  not others. With this new naming scheme WINDRx.EXE & NWDLLx.EXE (where x 
  stands for the latest revision) for Windows files and VLMUPx.EXE & NET33x.EXE
  for DOS, we can achieve this goal and provide the latest client files
  when needed revising only the specific downloadable file whose contents has
  changed.

  Because DOSUP9.EXE has also been divided into two files (VLMUP2.EXE and 
  NET33X.EXE), it should be noted that the Windows NETWARE.DRV v2.02 is version
  specific to NETX.EXE and has been moved into NET33X.EXE and is not found in 
  WINDR2.EXE. Novell's 16-bit solution is on VLMs rather than NETX.


Any comments or suggestions on how we can improve the delivery of these client 
update files are welcomed. Please send your responses to enhclient@novell.com
via Internet Mail.
