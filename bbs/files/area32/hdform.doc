S/W TITLE:      Winchester Hard Formatter

VERSION:        (FROM)  Vd 3.40.0   (TO)  VR 3.40.1

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

HDFORM is a low-level formatter and interleave optimiser for ST506/RLL disks 
on Apricot IBM compatible machines (both AT and MCA class). It does not 
support the formatting of Floppy, SCSI, or ESDI drives. The human interface is 
via a simple question/answer dialogue system, with answers consisting of Y, N, 
number, ESC, RETURN responses. The program can format completely new drives 
allowing the user to enter bad track information; It can re-format a disk 
obtaining bad track information from the previous format; It can calculate the 
optimum interleave factor for the disk/controller combination; It can re-
format a disk with a new interleave whilst preserving the old data; It can 
place an IBM compatible drive type record on track 2,head 0,cylinder 0 of the 
formatted drive. 

Options:

The program supports a number of optional command line parameters (which can 
be combined if required): 

1)      HDFORM          - Normal operation

2)      HDFORM /F       - Factory Format version (restricted choice)

3)      HDFORM /I n     - Set Interleave factor to n

4)      HDFORM /V       - Verbose mode - prints out internal status/timings

5)      HDFORM /L n m   - Format only between Cylinder n (highest) 
                                                   and m (lowest)

OPERATIONAL SUMMARY

When run without the /F command line option the sequence of operations is:

1       Signs on with version & date and asks which drive to format.
        (enter 1 or 2).
2       Shows Drive Name and size (if known), and number of heads, 
        cylinders,tracks - asks for confirmation (enter Y or N - n aborts 
        to DOS)

3       Asks if you wish to continue (enter Y or N - n aborts to DOS)

4       Asks whether to Format new drive with bad tracks entered by 
        operator (1), or to scan drive for previously formatted bad 
        tracks (2) (enter 1 or 2)

5       If first choice then the program asks if the user has any bad 
        tracks to enter (enter Y or N) - If Y then asks for up to 144 
        Cylinder,Head details terminated by entering ESC - onscreen prompts 
        show how to edit and make corrections.
        If second choice then the program scans the disk for bad sector 
        marks and builds a table which the user can edit (as in choice 1) 
        before proceeding.

6       Asks if the user wishes to optimise the interleave factor (enter Y 
        or N).
        If Y then the program performs read write tests on the test cylinder 
        to find the optimum interleave factor for the disk/controller (if 
        the /V option is set then the data transfer times are displayed for 
        the Interleave factors tested).

7       Asks if the user wishes to override the Interleave factor (enter Y 
        or N)
        If Y then the user can enter a single digit in the range 1 to 8.

8       Asks if the user wishes to use the SaveData option (enter Y or N)
        If Y then the following format will read the existing data, format 
        the track, and replace the data - thus preserving the contents of 
        the drive.

9       Asks the user if he wishes to continue (enter Y or N - N escapes to 
        DOS) 
        If Y then the drive is formatted starting at the highest cylinder and 
        stepping down to cylinder 0 (if the /L option is used then it formats 
        from the first cylinder number entered, down to the second one). 

10      Once the format is complete the program returns to DOS.

When run with the /F command line option the sequence of operations is:

1       Signs on with version & date and shows Drive 1 Name and size (if 
        known), and number of heads,cylinders,tracks, and Interleave Factor - 
        asks for confirmation (enter Y or N - N reboots the machine) 

2       If Y then the program asks if the user has any bad tracks to enter 
        (enter Y or N) - If Y then asks for up to 144 Cylinder,Head details 
        terminated by entering ESC - onscreen prompts show how to edit and make 
        corrections. If N then moves on to step 3. 

3       Asks the user if he wishes to continue (enter Y or N - N reboots the 
        machine) If Y then the drive is formatted starting at the highest 
        cylinder and stepping down to cylinder 0. 

4       Once the format is complete the program prompts for the ESC key, and 
        reboots the machine when entered. 

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES

HDFORM.EXE VR 3.40.1  13th Oct 88

Changes since VR 3.40.0

1)      Support for MCA architecture machines, inluding drive type 255 (CMOS 
        holds drive configuration data). 

2)      Default Interleave Factor on MCA and XEN-s machines set to 1:1, all 
        other machines set to 2:1. 

3)      Automatically places an IBM compatible Drive Type Record on Head 0, 
        Track 0, Sector 2 on newly formatted drive. 

VR 3.40.0

1.      Initial version for Qi and XEN-s range.

Vb 3.30.0

1.      Modified to allow formatting of ST506/RLL winchesters on MCA  
        Architecture machines (checked by looking at bit 1 of FLAG1 byte  
        returned by Int 15h function C0h) - this involves using other  CMOS RAM 
        storage locations for Drive Type. 

2.      Corrected bug introduced in Vd 3.20.0 which disallowed operator entry 
        of errors on last cylinder. 

Vd 3.20.0

1.      Inclusion of the factory format utility (FCFORM) into the  program - 
        specified with the /F switch. 

2.      Change of the bad track input routine to provide on-screen  editing 
        and up to 120 entries. 

3.      Return of the default interleave factor to 2.

4.      /I implementation of interleave switch.

Vc 3.20.0

1.      Default interleave factor reduced to 1.

2.      FCFORM - the provision of a command line input for the  interleave 
        factor. 

Vb 3.20.0

1.      Order of head formatting changed for the type 3 30M.

Va 3.20.0

1.      If no bad tracks are input, it does not ask if changes are required.

2.      ESC must be pressed before system re-boots, to avoid type ahead 
        problems. 

3.      Interrupt protection around CMOS ram accesses.

4.      Winchester types up to 47 supported.
