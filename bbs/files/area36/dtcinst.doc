                    DESKTOP COMMUNICATIONS SERVER INSTALLATION
          
          The  following  notes  explain  how  to  install  the  Desktop
          Communications Server  software on  VX-NET allowing the use of
          remote modems.    These  notes  are  only  a  outline,    full
          documentation on setting up and using the software is provided
          in the Desktop Communications Systems Administrators Guide.
          
          Some terms  which may  be unfamiliar  are described  under the
          heading TERMINOLOGY at the end of this document
          
          NETWORK CONFIGURATION
          
          1.   Ensure that  all the  Users who  wish to  utilize the DTC
               software can run Windows version 2.1 and have access to a
               copy of  the DTC  software provided  with the Qi or XEN-S
               Environment Packs,  these can  be loaded  either from the
               file-server or locally.  It is better to try and load the
               Windows  and   DTC  software  locally  as  this  improves
               performance.
          
               The Workstations on which the DTC software is to run will
               need to have the correct Authorisation Key installed.
          
          2.   The Workstations  on the  network which are to be used as
               Communications Systems need to have the modems installed.
               Depending on  the type  of modem  being used  it  may  be
               necessary to  disable the  on-board  serial  port  if  an
               internal, i.e.  a Triplex  modem, is  to be  addressed as
               COM1:.
          
          SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION
          
          Once all  the network  hardware and  software has  been  setup
          correctly then the installation of the DTC server software can
          take place.
          
          From the disk provided with the VX-NET 3.11 upgrade containing
          the  DTC   Server  and   Mail  Server   software,   copy   the
          sub-directory DTCSERV  into the  root directory of a formatted
          floppy disk.  This disk is now the DTC Server disk and is used
          for the configuration of the system.
          
          1.   Boot the  server and workstations and logon as a user who
               has access  to Windows  2.1 and  a floppy  drive,  either
               local or  remote.   Load Windows and place the DTC Server
               disk in the floppy drive which can be accessed, change to
               that drive and load the file DTCGEN.
          
          2.   The software  will open  a dialogue  box prompting "Drive
               for DTC  files:", select  the drive  containing  the  DTC
               Server disk.   Another   dialogue  box may  appear saying
               that the  DTC data  files cannot  be opened,  continue by
               pressing the  space bar.   This  dialogue box  will  only
               appear if  the data files haven't yet been created or the
               wrong disk is selected from the previous dialogue box.
          
          3.   The Desktop Communications Configuration Window will then
               appear.   At the  stage it  will be necessary to know the
               following :-   
          
               What attributes the modems you are using have.
               What control files the modems will need.
               The type of telephone system (tone or pulse).
               The number needed to obtain an outside line.
               The locations  of the files for DTC, Windows and a Common
               area.
               The type of Security to be implemented.
               Whether the workstations have modems fitted.
               The configuration of the Communications Systems.
               The type of connections the users will have access to.
          
          4.   When all the above information is obtained it can then be
               entered into  the DTCGEN program to create the data files
               used by the software to configure the system.
          
          5.   From the  "System" menu  select the  "Attribute  name..."
               option, then  add the  various  attributes  for  all  the
               modems on  the network,  i.e. enter V21, V22 etc..  These
               should already be present.
          
          6.   From the  "System" menu  select  the  "Control  files..."
               option, then  add the  names of  the control  files which
               need to be used by the modems on the network, i.e. if you
               are using  an Apricot Triplex modem enter TRIPLEX or if a
               Hayes compatible  modem is being used enter HAYES.  These
               should already be present.
          
          7.   From the  "System" menu  select the  "Telephone lines..."
               option, select the type of lines being used, i.e. tone or
               pulse, for  both the external and internal lines and also
               the number  that needs  to be  dialled to  get an outside
               line.
          
          8.   From the  "System" menu  select  the  "Default  paths..."
               option, then  enter the  drive and  sub-directories  from
               which the majority of users will access DTC , Windows and
               common files.
          
          9.   From the  "System" menu  select the  "Change Security..."
               option, select  the type  of security  to be  used.  If a
               change is made a dialogue box will appear warning the any
               existing users may be lost, select yes or no depending on
               whether your selection is correct.
          
               If VX-NET security has been selected another dialogue box
               may be  displayed asking  for the  location  of  the  DTC
               files, select the letter containing the DTC Server floppy
               disk.
          
          10.  From the  "View" menu  make sure  that the "Workstations"
               option is  highlighted, then  from the "Edit" menu choose
               the "Add" option.
          
               Enter the  Station number,  this will  be the VX-NET node
               number.
          
               Then the  Number of  Remote Connections,  how many modems
               the workstation  can access across the network at any one
               time.
          
               Then the  Base Remote Connection, the number of the first
               modem located  in the  Communications  System  after  any
               local modems  are taken  into account,  i.e if  two local
               modems are fitted to the workstation then the base remote
               connection will be 3.
          
               Then change  the paths  for the  DTC and  Windows file if
               they differ from those setup previously.   If these paths
               are local  to the  workstation mark the "Files local" box
               accordingly.
          
               This will  need to be done for all the workstations which
               are going to be running DTC.
          
               Local  devices  on  the  workstations  can  be  added  by
               selecting the  "Devices" option  and following  the  same
               procedure as  for setting  up the  Communications  System
               under section 11.
          
          11.  From the  "View" menu  make sure that the "Comms systems"
               option is  highlighted, then  from the "Edit" menu choose
               the "Add" option.
          
               A dialogue  box will  appear, in  this enter  the station
               number for Communications System, the VX-NET node number,
               and the  maximum number of connections the Communications
               System will  support at  any one time, this will normally
               be the number of modems installed.
          
               The   from the  Edit menu select the "Devices" options, a
               new window  will appear.  From the "Edit" menu select the
               "Ports..." option.
          
               Enter the first 8250 port (serial port) to be used by the
               Communications System.
          
               Then in the next box enter the total number of 8250 ports
               to be used on this Communications System.
          
               Do the same for any Chase ports if fitted.
          
               Highlight the  particular port  to be configured and from
               the "Edit" menu select the "Modems..." option.
          
               Enter the  device name,  this is  used  to  differentiate
               between the  various modems  being used  i.e. TRIPLEX ONE
               can be entered.
          
               Then enter the number of the telephone line that modem is
               using.
          
               Under the  "Device flags"  options  highlight  the  boxes
               according to  your configuration.   Whether  the modem is
               connected to  an external  telephone  line,  whether  the
               modem has  off hook  detection  and  if  a  telephone  is
               connected to the modems line.
          
               Under the  "Control file"  options highlight  the control
               the modem  requires.  If a Apricot Triplex modem is being
               installed select "TRIPLEX".
          
               Under the  "Attributes" options select the facilities the
               modem being  configurated is  capable of,  i.e. V21,  V22
               etc..
          
               When these screen has been completed choose the "ADD" box
               and repeat  for all  the  modems  in  the  Communications
               Systems.   To  go  back  to  the  original  screen  close
               Communications Systems window.
          
               Repeat this  for all  the Communications  Systems on  the
               network.
          
          12.  If either  Standard or  VX-NET security has been selected
               it will be necessary to setup and configure the Users, if
               no security  has been  chosen the  Users option cannot be
               selected therefore proceed to section 13.
          
               To configure  the user select the "Users" option from the
               "View" menu.
          
               If Standard  security was selected then it will necessary
               to add  all the  Users who will have access to DTC on the
               network.  This is done by selecting the "Add" option from
               the "Edit"  menu and  entering the  "user  name"  in  the
               dialogue box  displayed.  The other entry denotes whether
               the user is a System Administrator,  if this is select it
               will  allow   this  user  to  change  the  dialling  card
               information when  DTC is  loaded, otherwise this facility
               is disabled.
          
               If VX-NET  security was  selected then  all  the  network
               users setup  by "netgen  are displayed,  it will  then be
               necessary to  specify which of these users will be System
               Administrators and  delete any  users who are not allowed
               access to the DTC software.
          
               Once all  the user  have been listed it is then necessary
               to setup  the types of connections for these users.  This
               is done by selecting the relevant user and then selecting
               the "Connections..." option from the Edit menu.  From the
               new window  which is  displayed select  the "Add"  option
               from the  "Edit" menu  and from  the dialogue  box  which
               appears select the desired "Attribute" by highlighting it
               and selecting  the "Add"  box.  This needs to be done for
               ever attribute that the user will need.
          
               Repeat the above process for all the users.
          
          13.  Once all  the  Communications  System,  Workstations  and
               Users have  been setup  the information has to be written
               to disk.   this  is  done  by  selecting  the  "Configure
               system" option  from the  "Configure" menu.    This  will
               prompt for a drive to store the DTC data files on, select
               the drive which contains the DTC Server software.
          
          14.  The DTCGEN software can now be closed and windows exited.
               The  DTC   server  disk   now  contains   the   necessary
               information  the   configure  all  the  Workstations  and
               Communications Systems.
          
               This is done by running a program called DTCMAKE on every
               Workstation and   Communications  System which  is to use
               DTC.  The program is on the DTC Server disk used earlier.
          
               This program  needs to  be run from MS-DOS, from a floppy
               drive accessible  by the  workstation  being  configured,
               either local  or remote.  The software will first ask for
               the disk  drive that the workstation boots form, then the
               drive containing  the DTC  data files.  Select the drives
               according to the workstations configuration, the software
               will then prompt for a conformation of this.
          
               If "Y"  is enter  then the  configuration data is loaded,
               the  next   prompts  ask   whether  the  Workstations  or
               Communications Systems CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT should
               be changed, select "Y" for both these.
          
               The software will the amend these files changing the path
               command and loading the correct device driver.
          
               It will  be necessary  to copy  the driver files into the
               common disks  softdisk,  MSDOS32I.DSK  and  MSDOS33I.DSK,
               this is  done by entering the following in the "NETWKMGR"
               sub-directory on the server :-
          
               SOFTCOPY n:WCOMRDR.EXE MSDOS33I.DSK
               SOFTCOPY n:WCHASE.EXE MSDOS33I.DSK
               SOFTCOPY n:WCHSRMEM.SYS MSDOS33I.DSK
               SOFTCOPY n:W8250.EXE MSDOS33I.DSK
               
               where n:  is the  source drive  containing the DTC Server
               disk.
          
               This  may  need  to  be  repeated  for  the  MSDOS32I.dsk
               softdisk.
          
          14.  When all the Communications Systems and workstations have
               been configured reboot the whole network.  You should now
               be able  to  load  Windows  and  run  DTC  following  the
               information given  in  the  Desktop  Communications  User
               Guide provided with the Qi and XEN-S Environment Packs.
          
          **** Warning ****
          
          If "NETGEN" is used to re-produce any of the Workstations boot
          disks this  will overwrite any changes made by "DTCMAKE".  The
          "DTCMAKE" routine  will have  to be  re-done  to  allow  these
          Workstations to access DTC across the network.
          
          TERMINOLOGY
          
          COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS - These are Workstations on the network
          dedicated to  communications.   These  computers  have  Modems
          and/or Chase  cards installed  which are to be accessed by the
          DTC software running on other workstations on the network.
          
          ATTRIBUTES
          
          The capabilities of a modem i.e. V21, V22, V23 or V22bis etc..
          
          CONTROL FILES
          
          These are the files which control the modem.
          
          SECURITY
          
          DTC Server has three types of security these are :-    
          None, no logon or password are needed.
          
          Standard, users  are created  from within  DTCGEN and  a users
          logon and password need to entered when DTC is run.
          
          VX-NET, the  users VX-NET  logon and  password are accepted as
          valid for loading DTC.
          
          8250
          
          This is  what DTC  refers to  as a  serial port  i.e COM1:  or
          COM2:.
          

          NOTE:
          The W8250.EXE line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT of the comms gateway will 
          have to be edited to include the following switch (after those 
          that are already there!) 
                /S:n
          where n is the number of devices being shared remotely.
