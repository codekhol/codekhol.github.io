                             MAIL SERVER INSTALLATION
          
          The following  notes explain  how to  install the  Mail Server
          software on  VX-NET.   These notes  are only an outline,  full
          documentation on setting up and using the software is provided
          with the VX-NET 3.11 package.
          
          Network Configuration
          
          Any network  User who  will have  a mailbox on the system will
          need to  have access  to a  drive M: on the file-server.  This
          drive  needs   to  be  setup  on  the  network  as  a  Generic
          Application, so  that any  workstation can  "see" it.  This is
          done using  the "NETGEN"  program  supplied  with  the  VX-NET
          software in the usual way.
          
          Once this  has been  done the Mail Server software can then be
          installed as follows :-
          
          1.   Stop the Server,  the installation can be run either from
               the Server,  if it  has a  keyboard and screen fitted, or
               from a Workstation by stopping the server using "CONMGR".
          
          2.   Once the  Server is displaying "Server C:\>" prompt place
               the VXNet  3.11 Upgrade  disk containing  the MAIL Server
               software into  the Server's  floppy drive  and change  to
               that drive.  The Mail software NEEDS to be installed from
               drive A:.
          
          3.   At the  floppy drive  prompt change  to the sub-directory
               "MAILSERV" and  run the program "INSTALL".  This will ask
               for a  drive to  store the  Server component  of the Mail
               software,  enter "C" at the prompt.
          
          4.   The install  routine will  then create  the  Mail  server
               software on  the Servers  hard disk  in the "C:\COURIER".
               When  this   is  completed   change  to  this  drive  and
               sub-directory.
          
          5.   Type "ADMIN -DC" to load the Mail Administration program,
               a prompt  will  appear  asking  for  a  "Mailbox",  enter
               "ADMIN".   The next  prompt "Password"  will then appear,
               enter "PASSWORD".
          
          6.   The Configuration  programs main  menu is  now displayed,
               select the  "Local-Admin" option  followed by the "GROUP"
               option.
          
          7.   From the  "GROUP" menu select the "CREATE" option.  Enter
               the name of a group as "ALL" followed by carriage return.
               A box  will then  be displayed  with  "Admin"  in,  enter
               carriage return.   A  message will  then appear prompting
               "Create new Group?" select the "Yes" option.
          
          8.   The "ADMIN"  program can  now be  exited,  this  is  done
               pressing the  "ESC" key three times then select the "Yes"
               option at the "QUIT?" prompt.
          
          9.   The files in the "COURIER" sub-directory will now need to
               be copied  to the  to the correct directory on the server
               so that  they can  be accessed  by the  users.    If  the
               application was  called "MAIL"  within "NETGEN"  then the
               syntax to  copy the  files to  the correct  location will
               be :-
          
                    COPY C:\COURIER\*.* C:\APPLIC\GENERIC\MAIL
          
               This needs to be entered from MS-DOS.
          
          10.  When the  files have  been copied  change directories  to
               "C:\APPLIC\GENERIC\MAIL" and  enter the  following, again
               from MS-DOS, to make certain file read only.
          
                    ATTRIB +R MAILFONT.FON
                    ATTRIB +R ADMIN.EXE
                    ATTRIB +R ADMIN.HLP
                    ATTRIB +R NCVER.EXE
                    ATTRIB +R NCVER.VER
                    ATTRIB +R MAILBACK.EXE
                    ATTRIB +R MAILREST.EXE
          
          11.  The installation  of the  software is  now complete,  the
               Server and Workstations can now be re-booted.
          
          12.  When the  Network is  running logon  as a  User  who  has
               access to  drive M: on the network.  The configuration of
               the Users  and Groups is carried out by using the "ADMIN"
               program.
          
          13.  Change to drive M: and enter "ADMIN".  There is a mailbox
               already setup  to allow the system to be configured, this
               mailbox  is   called  "ADMIN"   and  has   the   password
               "PASSWORD".
          
          14.  Once the  main menu  is display  select the "Local-Admin"
               option.  This is where the "housekeeping of the system is
               carried.   When the  necessary Users and Groups have been
               setup the system is ready for use.
          
          To access  the  Mail  software  and  send  messages  to  other
          Mailboxes on  the system  a program called "WINMAIL.EXE" needs
          to be  run on  the Workstations  the users  are using.    This
          program is  provided with  the Qi  and XEN-S Environment Packs
          and needs  to be  run from  Windows the  documentation for the
          program is contained in the relevant Environment Packs.
