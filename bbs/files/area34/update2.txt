3) Files common to both VX-Net 2(1C) and 3.03

Files changed are as follows:-

QUAD.SYS        Vr 3.20.1       Fixes problems associated with using the QUAD 
                                card over the network that could cause serial 
                                printers on the QUAD card to hang. 

MSCALC.SYS      Vd 3.30.1       Overcomes some of the 'hanging' keyboard 
                                problems found with the EECO 'AT style' 
                                keyboards when odd combinations of CTRL keys 
                                were used. 

TRESTORE.EXE    Vb 3.20.6       Gives a verify option that checks the data on 
                                the tape against that on the disk (/c). Also 
                                includes support for the DOS VERIFY command 
                                (reads back everything that is written to disk 
                                to check (/v)). 


The Update Procedure :

Before proceeding with any update please ensure that you have an adequate 
backup of the system. 

In order to update the server software, it is recommended that you ensure that 
everyone is logged off the network, and that you then stop the network and 
work at the DOS prompt at the server, either via CONMGR or at the server 
itself. 

After you have stopped the server, insert the floppy update disk in the floppy 
drive, and then type the following command:-

        UPDATE <source> <destination>

where <source> is the drive letter of the floppy drive (ie A), and 
<destination> is the drive letter of the server hard disk where the network 
software is installed (ie C). The update procedure will then run. 

It is recommended that you do NOT break out of the routine once it is running, 
as it may leave the network software in an unstable state (you are given the 
opportunity at the start to quit without making changes if necessary). 


NOTE :

After installing this update on a VX_Net release 2(1C) network, the network 
will then be at Release 2.1 (typing 'WHAT VERSION' on the root of the server 
will confirm this). Likewise, an MF Release 7 network will become an MF 
Release 7.1 network.
