Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) NET387A contains an updated 
driver for SCO LLI (Link Layer Interface) Drivers Release 3.4.0.  This 
updated LLI driver (pnt) applies to the following network cards:


AMD
===
AMD Am1500T PCnet-ISA
AMD Am1500T/2 PCnet-ISA
AMD Am2110-SM AT Ethernet 7998 
AMD PCnet-ISA+
AMD PCnet-PCI


Hewlett Packard
===============
HP J2405A Ethertwist PC LAN Adapter NC/16 TP


Racal Interlan
==============
PCI-T2


NOTE: Before installing SLS NET387A, make sure all chains that contain 'pnt' 
      in the netconfig utility have been removed.  For example, 'sco_tcp->pnt0'
      would represent the first pnt card 'pnt0' configured over SCO TCP/IP.
      When prompted to relink the kernel, answer 'y'es  to all prompts to 
      ensure that all 'pnt' configurations in the kernel have been removed 
      and the kernel relink is successful. 


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

To install SLS NET387A, take the following steps:

NOTE: Do not proceed unless SCO LLI Release 3.4.0 is installed.
      (To verify, type 'swconfig' and look for the line 'LLI Driver Disk')

1. Shutdown and reboot the system.  Enter System Maintenance mode by 
   typing the root password at the prompt:

   Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
   (or give root password for System Maintenance)

2. Type:

   /etc/custom

3. The main custom menu will appear.  The "Install" option will be 
   highlighted.  Press <Return> to select the "Install" option.

4. A list of installed products will appear.  The first item in the 
   list, "A New Product", will be highlighted.  Press <Return> to 
   select "A New Product".

5. Custom will now display the installation options.  By default,
   "Entire Product" will be highlighted.  Press <Return> to select
   "Entire Product".

6. Custom will prompt you to insert "Distribution Floppy 1".  Insert
   the enclosed diskette into the drive and press <Return> while 
   "Continue" is highlighted. 

7. After extracting some information from the diskette, custom will 
   display information indicating that it is saving several files.  
   Custom will once again prompt you to insert volume 1.  Press 
   <Return> while "Continue" is highlighted.

8. After completing these steps, you will be returned to the main custom
   menu.  You may quit out of custom at this time.  After leaving the 
   custom utility, you will need to add the chains via the 'netconfig' 
   utility.  netconfig will now use the updated 'pnt' driver.
