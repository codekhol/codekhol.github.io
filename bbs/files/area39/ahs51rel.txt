 Chapter 1
 Installing the AHS 5.1.0 software

    Install the Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0 using the Software
    Manager (see ``Installing software'' in the SCO OpenServer Handbook).
    You can install the entire product or a single component.  For the Mass
    Storage and Multiprocessing Drivers components, you can also install a
    single driver package.

    AHS Release 5.1.0 can be installed only on SCO OpenServer Release 5
    (5.0.0).

    _________________________________________________________________________
       WARNING  Note the following before installing Advanced Hardware
       Supplement Release 5.1.0:

       +  Do not install AHS 5.1.0 on a system that is a server for
          networked operating system installation (initial system load, or
          ISL).  The AHS software modifies system files that are required
          for networked ISL, and after it is installed, networked ISLs
          will no longer be possible from that machine.

       +  If you remove the Graphics Drivers or Network Drivers components
          of the AHS software from the system after it is installed, you
          must reinstall some software from the original SCO OpenServer
          Release 5 release media.  See ``Restoring software after
          removing Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0''.

       +  Do not select single driver or documentation packages from the
          Network Driver or Graphics Drivers components.  Installing any
          single package from these components will delete all other
          drivers in that package from your system.  If you install only
          the documentation package, you will delete all drivers of that
          type from your system.  See ``Note about SSOs and AHS 5.1.0''.

    _________________________________________________________________________


 Installation

    The following procedure installs the AHS software:

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  The installation model for Advanced Hardware Supplement
       Release 5.1.0 favors installation from disk files that are
       available either locally or over the network.  The Advanced
       Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0 can also be installed directly
       from floppy disks but the installation will take considerably
       longer and cannot be left to run unattended.
    _________________________________________________________________________


    1.  Log in as root. Enter the following to bring your machine into system
        maintenance mode:  /etc/shutdown -i1

    2.  If the AHS software is not yet accessible (on a local or remote
        machine), load it now into files in the /ahs5_1 directory or other
        directory of your choice.

        +  To load from floppy disks:

           Copy the floppies to the local hard disk with these commands:

              mkdir /ahs5_1
              dd if=/dev/fd0  of=/ahs5_1/VOL.000.000 bs=36b
              dd if=/dev/fd0  of=/ahs5_1/VOL.001.000 bs=36b
              dd if=/dev/fd0  of=/ahs5_1/VOL.002.000 bs=36b
              dd if=/dev/fd0  of=/ahs5_1/VOL.003.000 bs=36b
              dd if=/dev/fd0  of=/ahs5_1/VOL.004.000 bs=36b

           The block size shown (bs=36b) is recommended for 3-1/2 inch
           floppies; for 5-1/4 inch floppies, use bs=30b.

           _________________________________________________________________________
              NOTE  The AHS installation files can be loaded into any
              directory you choose, but the actual file names must be the
              ones shown above.
           _________________________________________________________________________


        +  To load from SCO's Internet site using ftp:

           Create a directory (such as /ahs5_1) and cd into it.  Then,
           transfer the files with these commands:

              ftp -i ftp.sco.com
                      <log in as anonymous>
                      <give your email address for the password>
              cd AHS/5.0/sco/5.1
              mget VOL*
              exit

           See the README file for additional information.

    3.  Run the Software Manager from the desktop, or enter scoadmin software
        from the command line.  Select Install New from the Software menu.

    4.  Identify the installation source:

        +  To install from files on the local host, select the current host
           and specify Media Images as the media device.  Then, enter the
           name of the directory containing the media images (for example,
           /ahs5_1).

        +  To install directly from floppy disks, select the current host and
           specify the correct Floppy Disk Drive.  Insert your floppy disk
           and click on Continue.

        +  To install from another host, select From another host.  Specify
           the host that contains the AHS software files, and enter the
           swadmin password for that host when prompted.

           -  If AHS is installed on the remote host, specify Hard Disk as
              the media device, then select SCO OpenServer Advanced Hardware
              Supplement.

           -  If the AHS images are loaded onto the remote host but not
              installed, specify Media Images as the media device.  Then
              enter the full pathname of the directory containing the media
              images.

        It will take about one minute for a set of control files to be
        copied.

    5.  Choose a Full or Partial installation:

        +  To install the entire Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0
           product, click on Full.

        +  To install only one component (such as Graphics Drivers, Network
           Drivers, or Mass Storage Drivers), click on Partial, then select
           the components you want from the list of available software and
           click on Install.  The components are described in ``AHS
           components''.

        +  To install one or more drivers from the Mass Storage or
           Multiprocessing Drivers component, click on Partial, then expand
           the component that contains the drivers you want to install.  From
           the list of available drivers, select the ones you want and click
           on Install.

           ____________________________________________________________________
              WARNING  Do not select single driver or documentation
              packages from the Graphics Drivers component or the Network
              Drivers component.  See ``Note about SSOs and AHS 5.1.0''.
           ____________________________________________________________________


    6.  When the installation is complete, select Exit from the Host menu.

    7.  When the system prompt returns, you can delete the Advanced Hardware
        Supplement Release 5.1.0 volume image files from your system if they
        are not required for other installations.

    8.  If the kernel was relinked, you must reboot your system for the
        changes to take effect.  Type init 6, then press <Enter> to reboot
        your system.

    When the system comes up, the new drivers are installed.  Store the
    distribution media in a safe place.


 AHS components

    Installing the Entire product requires approximately 8.5MB of disk space.
    You can choose to install one or more of the following packages and
    components:

    Graphics Drivers
         Includes graphics drivers, grafinfo files, and moninfo files for all
         supported graphics devices, plus an updated version of the Video
         Configuration Manager, a revised Configuring Video Adapters book,
         and new context-sensitive help for the video configuration software.

         Installing this component will update any configured devices on your
         system.  Additional devices can be configured with the Video
         Configuration Manager after the AHS software is installed.

         See Chapter 2, ``Graphics drivers: new features'' and Chapter 3,
         ``Graphics drivers: notes and known limitations''.

    Network Drivers

         plus an updated version of the Network Configuration Manager, a
         revised Configuring Network Connections book, and new context-
         sensitive help for the network configuration software.

         Installing this component will update any configured devices on your
         system.  Additional devices can be configured with the Network
         Configuration Manager after the AHS software is installed.

         See Chapter 4, ``Network drivers: new features for this release''
         and Chapter 5, ``Network drivers: notes and known limitations''.

    AHS Upgrade Utility
         Provides support for other AHS components.  Do not select this
         component for installation; it is automatically installed by the
         other components that require it.

    Mass Storage Drivers
         Driver binaries and support files for SCSI host adapters and the
         SCSI jukebox peripheral driver.  See Chapter 6, ``Mass storage
         drivers: notes and known limitations''.

         The boot-time loadable drivers that are included in the Mass Storage
         Drivers component can be installed directly at boot time using the
         link(HW) or ahslink commands; See ``Using BTLDs at installation
         time''.

    Multiprocessing Drivers
         Software to support the Tricord PowerFrame platform.  See Chapter 7,
         ``Multiprocessing drivers: notes and known limitations''.


 Note about SSOs and AHS 5.1.0

    The Network Drivers and Graphics Drivers components of Advanced Hardware
    Supplement Release 5.1.0 use the SCO OpenServer Software Storage Object
    (SSO) architecture.  For SCO OpenServer Release 5, each of these
    components was contained in a single SSO.  In Advanced Hardware
    Supplement Release 5.1.0, these large SSOs are replaced by a collection
    of smaller SSOs to allow for more flexible upgrades in future releases.
    Because of this paradigm switch, SCO recommends that you install the
    entire Network Drivers or Graphics Drivers components rather than
    installing single driver or documentation packages from these components.

    The Mass Storage and Multiprocessing Drivers components are not affected
    by this paradigm switch so single driver packages can be installed from
    these components.


 Removing the AHS software

    The Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0 software is not normally
    removed once it is installed from the system and full roll-back
    capability is not supported.  The software can be removed using the
    Software Manager, but you will then need to reinstall portions of
    software from the original SCO OpenServer Release 5 media.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       WARNING  The system should be in system maintenance mode when
       removing and restoring AHS software.  Specifically, be sure that no
       NFS automounts are active when removing these components; during
       the removal process, TCP will be deconfigured, which can cause
       problems if there are active NFS mounts.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    To remove the Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0 software:

    1.  Log in as root. Enter the following to bring your machine into system
        maintenance mode:  /etc/shutdown -i1

    2.  Select Software Manager from the Desktop or enter scoadmin software
        at the command line.

    3.  Select SCO Advanced Hardware Supplement from the list of installed
        software, then select Remove from the Software menu.  Study the
        messages displayed; if you still want to remove the software, click
        on OK to confirm the removal.

    4.  Select Exit from the Host menu.  The Advanced Hardware Supplement
        Release 5.1.0 software has now been removed.


 Restoring software after removing Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0

    After removing the Graphics Drivers or Network Drivers packages from
    Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0, you will need to restore
    files from the original SCO OpenServer Release 5 release media to return
    your system to the state it was in before installing the AHS software.

    To do this, take the following steps after removing the AHS software as
    discussed in ``Removing the AHS software'':

    1.  From the list of available software in the Software Manager, record
        which SCO OpenServer Release 5 system you are using (Enterprise,
        Host, or Desktop).

    2.  Select Install New from the Software menu.  Select the current host,
        identify the media device (tape or CD-ROM), and insert your original
        SCO OpenServer Release 5 distribution media.

 Chapter 2
 Graphics drivers: new features

    The Graphics Drivers component of Advanced Hardware Supplement Release
    5.1.0 provides the following new capabilities:

    PCI auto-detection
          The updated Video Configuration Manager provides automatic device
          detection for supported PCI graphics adapters.

    High resolution graphics mode
          Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0 enables you to configure
          your graphical system to 1600x1200 at 256 (or more) colors, which
          is significantly better than the resolutions supported in earlier
          releases.  New adapters supporting this resolution are marked with
          an asterisk ``*'' in ``New video adapters in AHS 5.1''.  You must
          have enough DRAM or VRAM on the video adapter and you must use a
          compatible video monitor that supports this resolution.

    When you install the Graphics Drivers component of Advanced Hardware
    Supplement Release 5.1.0, existing graphics adapters and monitors will be
    updated automatically.  To configure new adapters and monitors, run the
    Video Configuration Menu after you complete the AHS installation.
    Changes will take effect when you restart the X server.


 New video adapters in AHS 5.1

    The following graphics adapters are newly supported in Advanced Hardware
    Supplement Release 5.1.0.  The video adapters marked with an asterisk (*)
    support the 1600x1200 resolution at 256 or more colors.

       Compaq ProLinea, Deskpro (CL GD5434, 1MB)
       Compaq ProLinea, Deskpro (CL GD5434, 2MB)
       Compaq QVision 2000 (2 MB)
       Diamond Stealth 64 DRAM (S3 Vision868 chip set)
       Diamond Stealth 64 VRAM (S3 Vision968 chip set)
       Diamond Viper PRO*
       Diamond Viper SE*
       IBM Thinkpad (Western Digital 90C24)
       Matrox MGA/Impression PCI Graphics Adapter*
       Matrox MGA VLB Graphics Adapter*
       Number 9 FX Motion 771*
       Number 9 FX Vision 330


 Updated video adapters in AHS 5.1

    Some of the Graphics drivers have been enhanced and improved over the
    versions that were included in SCO OpenServer Release 5.

    Improvements were made to the drivers for the following video adapters:

       Compaq QVision 1024 (1 MB)
       Compaq QVision 1280 (2 MB)

    Note also that the X driver for the Cirrus Logic GD5434 chipset has been
    corrected for a hardware problem that caused many adapters based on this
    chipset to hang.  Installing Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0
    provides the updated X driver; the change will take effect the next time
    you restart the X server.  The new Driver resets the ``blitter'' if a
    hang is detected.  Some drawing errors may be noticed if this reset
    occurs.  This affects the following video adapters:

       Cirus Logic GPS434
       Orchid Kelvin 64

    Other graphics adapters based on the Cirrus Logic GD5434 chip set may
    also be affected.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       CAUTION  If your system uses one of these graphics adapters or
       drivers, you should select the in-place upgrade during system
       installation to preserve your existing functionality.  If you
       perform a fresh installation and later want to use one of these
       adapters or drivers, contact SCO Support for information about the
       ``Legacy'' program.
    _________________________________________________________________________


 VGA and Super-VGA (mw) driver does not run if you switch multiscreens

    If you are using a graphics adapter that uses the mw X driver (typically
    a VGA or Super-VGA-only card that does not contain a graphics
    acceleration chip), the driver stops running and the X server ceases to
    do graphics rendering when you switch to a different multiscreen.
    Activity is reinitiated when you return to the multiscreen on which the X
    server is running.


 Drawing problems when moving Desktop icons

    Occasionally, if Desktop icons are moved across the top of the Desktop
    under the menu bar, incorrect pixels are drawn. Using Refresh from the
    window manager Root menu clears the incorrectly drawn pixels.


 Color problems when using TrueColor and DirectColor with SCO X clients

    If you specify the -cmap option for the SCOcolor, SCOpaint, and SCOpaint
    clients, TrueColor and DirectColor visual types will not work.
    (DirectColor and TrueColor cards typically support 32K, 64K, and 16
    Million colors).  This problem also results if you start Xsco with the -
    static option.  These are the visual types where the rgb values are
    stored directly in the display memory of the adapter.  Consult the
    documentation accompanying your graphics adapter.  If there are display
    modes that support 32K, 64K, or 16 Million colors, do not use these
    modes.

    Also, the applications mentioned above do not work with fixed colormap
    graphics adapters.


 Using grey-scale monochrome monitors with the X server

    Running startx with some grey-scale monitors (sometimes incorrectly
    called monochrome) causes the system to crash.  If this happens, you must
    ensure that the console ports are properly configured.  To configure your
    ports automatically at boot-up complete the following:

    1.  As root, use an ASCII editor (such as vi) to open
        /etc/rc.d/8/userdef.

    2.  Add the following lines:

           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty01
           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty02
           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty03
           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty04
           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty05
           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty06
           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty07
           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty08
           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty09
           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty10
           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty11
           vidi v80x25 < /dev/tty12
           echo "Screen devices set to color mode ..."


    3.  Save the file.

    4.  Use shutdown(ADM) or init(M) to reboot your machine.

    5.  Start the X server.


 Problems exiting the X server

    If you use startx to start the X server, you may notice problems when
    exiting your SCO system Desktop or X server.  Sometimes, the screen
    remains in graphics mode or the keyboard does not function correctly
    after exiting.

    To prevent the problem, use /etc/clean_screen along with startx by
    entering the following:

       startx; /etc/clean_screen

    If you log in via scologin, you should not encounter any problems.


 WordPerfect limitations

    If you use WordPerfect(r) with a non-VGA graphics adapter and you move a
    window or the cursor off the screen, the text screen does not display
    correctly.

    If you run WordPerfect with a VGA-based adapter, and you move the
    WordPerfect cursor off the screen to the left and then type, you see
    multiple cursor images (to the right of the text you are typing).

    In both cases, you can restore the correct screen display by selecting
    Refresh from the Root menu.


 Error messages when running /etc/fontserv

    If you run /etc/fontserv start, it may incorrectly produce the following
    error message:

       TCP/IP must be running before starting the font server.

    For the font server to run, you must modify the /etc/fontserv command.

    Enter the following commands as root:

       cp  /etc/fontserv  /etc/fontserv.bak
       sed '/slink/,/fi/d'  /etc/fontserv > /tmp/fontserv
       cat /tmp/fontserv > /etc/fontserv

    Once this is done, start the font server:

       /etc/fontserv  start

    If you need to restore the old version of fontserv, enter the following
    command as root:

       cat  /etc/fontserv.bak > /etc/fontserv


 Maximum number of local X servers

    SCO OpenServer Release 5 supports up to 8 local X servers.


 Hardware conflicts and multi-monitor configuration

    If you install two or more video adapters on the system, you must ensure
    that there are no hardware conflicts between them and other hardware in
    the system.


 Problems when exiting the Video Configuration Manager in character mode

    If the CHARM version of the Video Configuration Manager exits
    unexpectedly, you may be left in raw mode.  To correct this problem,
    complete the following steps:

    1.  Type <Ctrl>\ a few times to verify that CHARM has really stopped
        running.

    2.  Enter the following to restore your terminal setting:

           <Ctrl>J stty sane <Ctrl>J

 Network drivers: new features for this release

    This section contains information about the new features found in the
    Network Drivers component of Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0
    including:

    +  the new features supported in this release of Advanced Hardware
       Supplement

    +  the network adapters supported in this release of Advanced Hardware
       Supplement


 New features


    New and improved network adapters
         Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0 supports over 120 network
         adapters;  see ``Supported network adapters'' for the complete list.
         Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0 supports all the adapters
         found in SCO OpenServer Release 5 and adds support for the new
         adapters listed in ``New network adapters''.  Support for a number
         of adapters has been enhanced for robustness and performance; see
         ``Updated network adapters''.

    Fast Ethernet
         Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0 provides support for
         several new 100 Mbps network adapters, including support for both
         100VG and 100BaseT networking technologies.  Some of the new and
         updated drivers also support full-duplex data transfer mode when
         used with full-duplex hubs.

    Improved PCI support
         Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0 also provides a much
         wider selection of network adapters for the high-performance PCI
         bus.

    Multithreaded networking and network drivers
         Some of the network drivers included with Advanced Hardware
         Supplement Release 5.1.0 are multithreaded to provide better
         performance on multiprocessor configuration.  These multithreaded
         drivers can execute both their task-level code and interrupt
         processing on any configured CPU.  Single-threaded drivers (that
         have not been multithreaded) can be run on multiprocessor
         configurations; they will benefit from the multithreaded protocol
         stacks and STREAMS interface that are provided with SCO OpenServer
         but all driver execution will occur on one CPU.  Consequently,
         single-threaded drivers may not realize the full performance
         benefits of the multiprocessing configuration.

         The drivers for the following network adapters are multithreaded:
         +  Novell/Eagle NE3200
         +  Novell/Microdyne NE3200T
         +  Intel EtherExpress 32
         +  Intel EtherExpress Flash 32

         Additional multithreaded drivers are under development for future
         releases of the Advanced Hardware Supplement.

 STRMAXBLK kernel parameter changes

    The STREAMS implementation in SCO OpenServer Release 5 has changed from
    that of earlier releases so that the memory within a single data block is
    not guaranteed to reside in a single, physically-contiguous block.  This
    creates problems for STREAMS drivers that control devices with DMA
    transfer functions.  All SCO-provided network drivers have been modified
    for compatibility with the new STREAMS architecture; non-SCO LLI drivers
    for DMA-based network adapters (such as ZYNX) may not work correctly with
    the default SCO OpenServer Release 5 STRMAXBLK setting.

    The new STRMAXBLK kernel parameter defines the maximum size of STREAMS
    buffers. The default value of the STRMAXBLK parameter is 524288, but it
    can be set to any value that is a power of two between 4096 and 524288
    (4KB to 512KB).  Setting STRMAXBLK to 4096 has the effect of ensuring
    that all buffers allocated from STREAMS will be located in a physically
    contiguous block, which enables older LLI drivers to work properly with
    SCO protocol stacks and other networking products.  Note that changing
    STRMAXBLK to 4096 does not ensure that LLI drivers can work with non-SCO
    protocols that map in private data blocks.

    If you are using a DMA-based network adapter with a non-SCO provided LLI
    driver, use the configure(ADM) command to set the value of STRMAXBLK to
    4096 bytes, then relink the kernel and reboot the system.


 Using Plug-and-Play devices on SCO OpenServer systems

    SCO OpenServer Release 5 does not support the ISA Plug-and-Play standard.
    However, Plug-and-Play devices should work correctly if you follow these
    steps:

    1.  Run the DOS setup program to locate the card.

    2.  Disable the Plug-and-Play logic.

    3.  Set the network adapter to an unused I/O address.

    4.  Boot the UNIX system, run the Network Configuration Manager and
        configure the driver normally.  The Network Configuration Manager can
        successfully configure the hardware settings on the Plug-and-Play
        adapter if the driver configuration routine provides the ability to
        program those settings.


 Problems when searching for ISA cards

    Because of limitations in ISA architecture, when using the Search option
    in the Network Configuration Manager to search for an ISA network
    adapter, your system may hang or fail to respond after the search.  If
    this happens, restart netconfig and do not use the Search option to
    locate network adapters.  This is more likely to happen if you have more
    than one ISA network adapter installed in your system.


 Using command line options with netconfig


    +  Do not use capital letters when using netconfig to configure network
       connections.

    +  netconfig does not support the following command line options: -m -C
       -L.


 Network adapter performance with large data transfers

    If a networking adapter is not fast enough to keep up with the data it is
    asked to transfer, network products such as NFS and LAN Manager can
    experience delays, timeouts, and error messages when engaged in large
    data transfers. If this happens with NFS, the following message appears:

       NFS timeout

    If this happens with LAN Manager client, LAN Manager prints the following
    message:

       terminating read ahead with server server_name.

    Other networking services and applications that use unreliable transports
    (like UDP) can also suffer from this problem.  For example, because the
    3Com 3C501 adapter has a limited buffering capability, the timeout error
    occurs when using NFS and a large (2KB or more) buffer size. It can also
    occur when transferring data over a 16MB Token-Ring between a machine
    with a fast Token-Ring adapter and a machine with a slow one.  A similar
    error can occur with LAN Manager over a Novell/Eagle NE2000 adapter,
    yielding an ``Unexpected network error'' message.

    You can solve the problem in the following ways:

    -  For NFS, specify a smaller read/write buffer size in your NFS mount
       options.  1024 is a reasonable value for slower adapters.  For more
       information about configuring this option, see Read.write buffer size
       in the Networking Guide.

    -  For the LAN Manager client, specify a smaller read/write buffer size
       in your LAN Manager client filesystem mount options.  1024 is a
       reasonable value for slower adapters.  For more information about
       configuring this option, see ``LMC filesystem mount options'' in
       Chapter 4, ``Administering and using LAN Manager Client'' in the Guide
       to Gateways for LAN Servers.

    -  For LAN Manager servers, configure smaller values for the maxreadsize
       and  maxwritesize keywords in the lanman.ini file.  For additional
       details, consult your Microsoft LAN Manager for SCO Systems
       Administering LAN Manager guide.


 OSI and Token-Ring incompatibility

    Token-Ring drivers do not work properly for the OSI protocol stack
    because OSI uses illegal Token-Ring multicast addresses.


 Token-Ring source routing and IPX/SPX

    Token-Ring source routing may not work with the IPX/SPX protocol stack.


 Token-Ring hardware addresses

    The Hardware address parameter for IBM Token-Ring adapters does not set
    the new MAC address properly.


 Multiple SCOhelp clients spawned by the Network Configuration Manager

    netconfig configures many different types of hardware and software, so if
    you ask for help first from one part of netconfig, and then from another,
    your graphical environment may become littered with SCOhelp windows. If
    you do (and you find it annoying), you can simply close the windows you
    are not currently using. All the SCOhelp windows will close when you exit
    the manager.




 Chapter 6
 Mass storage drivers: notes and known limitations

    This chapter describes the Mass Storage Drivers component of the Advanced
    Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0.  These drivers are boot-time loadable
    and provide support for SCSI host adapters that may need to be link-
    edited into the SCO OpenServer(TM) kernel during the booting process.
    Supported SCSI host adapter drivers are:

    +  Adaptec 7770 (arad)

    +  Adaptec 7870 and 7850 (alad)

    +  Adaptec AIC-6x60 Host Adapter Driver (smad)

    +  Advanced Micro Devices (ams)

    +  DPTR (dptr)

    +  EIDE (wd)

    +  IBM Fixed Disk Adapter/A (esdi)

    +  Symbios Logic (bhba)

    +  Tricord 4-bus (iiop)

    The supported SCSI device (which is not boot-time loadable) is:

    +  SCSI jukebox (Sjk)

    This documentation also explains how these drivers can be installed after
    installation of the SCO OpenServer system.


 Contents of the Mass Storage Drivers component

    This component contains one Boot-Time Loadable Drivers' disk containing
    the software.  You should keep the floppy disk until the next release of
    the SCO OpenServer system. If you upgrade the software or hardware on
    your system, you may need to install or reinstall the Boot-Time Loadable
    Drivers.

    After some introductory notes, this chapter describes the installation
    procedure for the Mass Storage Drivers component followed by some release
    notes for each of the host adapters.  The release notes list supported
    hardware and known limitations.


 Definition of Boot-Time Loadable Drivers

    Boot-Time Loadable Drivers are drivers which can be link-edited into the
    SCO OpenServer system kernel during the booting process.  The
    link-editing is done by link(HW) or ahslink after the driver is loaded
    into memory (RAM) but before the kernel is started.  A BTLD enables SCO
    OpenServer to be installed either onto, or using, new hardware as soon as
    a driver for the hardware is available.

    The disk provided in this package is all you need to use this facility;
    no additional software is required to use BTLDs since link(HW) and
    ahslink are part of the SCO OpenServer system.


 Installation requirements

    The drivers in this Mass Storage Drivers component are only valid for SCO
    OpenServer Release 5.

    Before installing a driver, you should read the relevant release notes
    for the driver in this document.  The release notes contain configuration
    notes and known limitations for the drivers in this package.


 Installation procedure

    There are two possible scenarios in which you may need to install the
    Mass Storage Drivers component:

    1.  For installing new hardware which is required for your system at
        installation time.  In this case, you need to add one of the drivers
        included in the Mass Storage Drivers component before you can install
        the SCO OpenServer system.  To follow this procedure, you should
        proceed to ``Using BTLDs at installation time''.

    2.  For installing new hardware which you wish to add to your system
        after the installation of the SCO OpenServer system.  In this case,
        the Mass Storage Drivers component is treated as a package of drivers
        to be added to the Link Kit by the Software Manager.  To follow this
        procedure, proceed to Chapter 1, ``Installing the AHS 5.1.0
        software''.

 Using BTLDs at installation time

    This section describes how to install the new driver which is required
    for the installation of the SCO OpenServer system.  If you need to use
    your BTLD disk at installation time, you should have already inserted
    your boot disk.  After inserting the boot disk, the boot prompt is
    displayed; this is the point at which you begin the installation
    procedure for this SCO BTLD package.  At this stage the boot floppy disk
    should be in the drive, and the system should be displaying:

    SCO OpenServer(tm) Release 5

    Boot
    :


    1.  What you enter at the prompt depends on which driver you are
        installing.  Enter link at the ``:'' prompt if you are installing
        ams, bhba, or iiop drivers.  If you are installing alad, arad, dptr,
        esdi or wd drivers, enter ahslink. If you are installing smad, enter
        defbootstr link disable=spad (the smad driver replaces the older spad
        driver).

    2.  The screen displays the following prompt:

        What packages do you need linked in the system,
        or `q' to quit? :

        Available packages in this SCO BTLD package are:

        alad  Adaptec 7870 and 7850 Host Adapter Driver

        ams   Advanced Micro Devices

        arad  Adaptec 7770 Host Adapter Driver

        bhba  Symbios Logic Host Adapter Driver

        dptr  DPT - entire card line

        esdi  IBM Fixed Disk Adapter/A

        iiop  Tricord ES5000 Motherboards

        smad  Adaptec AIC-6x60 Host Adapter Driver

        wd    EIDE Driver

        To install the Sjk SCSI device (SCSI jukebox driver) use the Software
        Manager as described in Chapter 1, ``Installing the AHS 5.1.0
        software''.

        Enter only the packages which are required by the installation.  If
        you want to install the other packages on the disk, you should use
        the post-installation procedure as described in Chapter 1,
        ``Installing the AHS 5.1.0 software''.


    3.  Next, you will see a boot line similar to the following example:


        fd(64)unix ramdisk=f(64) rootfs root=ram(7) ram.preload=7 swap=none
        dump=none nbuf=100 link=pkg btld=fd(x)

        Memory found: 0k - 640k, 1m - 9600k

        pkg in the line above is replaced by the actual name of the driver
        package for boot-time loading and x is replaced by the minor number
        for your floppy device.

        After a moment, a series of prompts are displayed with trailing dots;
        these messages progress as software is loaded.

    4.  Next you see:

        Please insert the fd(x)pkg volume and press <Return>:

        Insert the requested volume (the SCO BTLD disk). The system prompts
        for and extracts the contents of the package.

        If the wrong volume is inserted or the drive is empty, the system
        displays the following:

        Sorry, that volume does not contain the pkg package

        followed by the insertion request again:

        Please insert the fd(x)pkg volume and press <Return>:


    5.  link(HW) and ahslink perform the linking of the extracted drivers
        into the kernel in core and may require more information for the
        extracted drivers.  If the system prompts you for more information
        about configuring in these drivers, refer to the link(HW) manual page
        in the Operating System Administrator's Reference Volume 2 .

        _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  If there are any errors during this extraction (linking)
           process, the process is aborted and you are forced to reboot.
        _________________________________________________________________________


    6.  After a series of messages culminating in a message such as:

        arad: Driver "arad" successfully loaded

        you will see a message prompting you to re-insert the boot disk.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  If the message:

           ... Characteristic '...' not supported;

           is displayed, you can safely ignore it.
        _________________________________________________________________________

        The Mass Storage Drivers component has been installed; you should now
        return to the installation procedure for SCO OpenServer.

        During the installation of the SCO OpenServer system you will be
        asked whether you want to customize your operating system.  At the
        very least, you must install the SCO OpenServer Run Time System (RTS)
        and the BASE and LINK packages of the SCO OpenServer Extended
        Utilities.

 Warning: installing over previously-installed BTLDs

    If a different version of a driver with the same name as an AHS driver is
    found during installation using the Software Manager, you will be asked
    whether you want to keep the driver already installed or overwrite it
    with the AHS version.

    You will see the following message:

    Driver <driver name> is already installed.
    Do you want to overwrite the installed driver (note: it will
    not be backed up)?"

    If you answer yes, the third-party driver and its configuration
    information is overwritten.  The new AHS driver will not be configured
    into the kernel.  You will need to turn on the driver by changing `N' in
    the driver's entry in /etc/conf/sdevice.d to `Y'.  Relink the kernel
    before rebooting.

 Installing BTLDs after initial installation

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  BTLD drivers installed at ISL are not visible to the Software
       Manager even though they are installed in the link kit. It is
       possible to custom-install a driver that has already been BTLD-
       installed and this may become recommended practice in future
       releases of AHS.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    To install the SCO BTLD package when the SCO OpenServer system is already
    installed, follow the steps described in Chapter 1, ``Installing the AHS
    5.1.0 software''.


 Removal procedure

    To remove the SCO BTLD package, follow the steps described in ``Removing
    the AHS software''.


 Adaptec AIC-7770 host adapter driver (arad)

    The arad driver directly supports the following host adapters:

    EISA bus

    AHA-2740/2742                (Single channel)
    AHA-2740/2742 A              (Single channel)
    AHA-2740/2742 T              (Twin channel)
    AHA-2740/2742 A-T            (Twin channel)
    AHA-2740/2742 W              (Wide channel)


    VL bus

    AHA-2840/2842VL              (VL Bus)

    This driver also supports the AIC-7770 chip in SCO Certified System
    platforms. Please refer to the SCO Hardware Compatibility Handbook to
    determine the support status of your host adapter, or contact your system
    supplier.

    BIOS notes

    The following notes apply to the Adaptec host adapter BIOS:

    +  If multiple 2740T host adapters are being used, under certain
       conditions, disable all BIOSs except for the boot host adapter.

    +  If the BIOS of the 2740T/2742T or the 2740A/A-T/2742/A/A-T is
       disabled, the driver will use the default setting configuration.

    Configuration utility notes

    The following notes apply to the card's configuration utility:

    +  You must save the configuration information before attempting to use
       the configuration utility.

    +  When termination on Channel B is not set up properly or if the
       2740T/2740A-T/2742A-T is not seated properly in the EISA slot, the
       configuration utility might falsely detect those adapters as 2740/42
       or as 2740W/2742W host adapters.

    The following general notes apply.

    +  The AHA-2740T/2742T and the 2740A/A-T/2742A/A-T do not support a
       synchronous rate lower than 3.6MB/s.

    +  The system may display a warning message if you try to do a fresh
       install of the driver at IRQ 10; this is because of the possibility of
       an interrupt collision.  Do not use IRQ 10 for a fresh installation.
       The IRQ can be changed to 10 for a driver previously installed.

    +  When adding a host adapter, the lowest BIOS address must correspond to
       the lowest EISA slot.

    +  Some hard disk drives which initiate synchronous negotiation will not
       be installed during BIOS scan when synchronous negotiation is disabled
       on the host adapter.  It is recommended that synchronous negotiation
       be left enabled (default) for hard disks.


 Adaptec AIC-7870 and AIC-7850 host adapter driver (alad)

    The alad driver directly supports the AHA-2940 and AHA-2940W host
    adapters.

    This driver also supports the AIC-7870 and AIC-7850 chip in SCO Certified
    System platforms. Please reference the SCO Hardware Compatibility
    Handbook to determine the support status of your host adapter or contact
    your system supplier.

    Configuration feature

    Host adapter configurations may be changed by editing the driver's
    space.c file. This file is located under the appropriate directory of
    /etc/conf/pack.d for the host adapter driver. In the case of the AHA-
    2940x, the relevant entry is in the directory /etc/conf/pack.d/alad.  You
    can alter the value of a number of parameters in this file including the
    SCSI ID, I/O port address, scatter/gather, tag queuing and
    connect/disconnect.

    Known problems

    The alad driver may not talk to a tape device. If a tape(C) command or
    data transfer is attempted on a SCSI tape device at any time after power
    up, the command will hang and all access to the SCSI bus is denied (you
    cannot access any other device on the SCSI bus the tape is on).

    The tape is holding the SCSI bus BUSY waiting for an acknowledgement of
    data it has previously sent. The adapter driver has become confused about
    the Synchronous Transfer parameters negotiated previously and does not
    realize it needs to send an acknowledgement.

    To avoid this problem, disable Synchronous Negotiation for the tape
    device in the Adaptec SCSI-Select BIOS.

    The data transfer rate to the tape device may be decreased slightly.
    This problem has only been observed on Apricot machines with Tandberg
    4200c and Archive Viper 525 tape drives.


 Adaptec AIC-6x60 host adapter driver (smad)

    The smad driver directly supports:

    AHA-1510

    AHA-1510 A

    AHA-1520

    AHA-1520 A

    AHA-1522

    AHA-1522 A

    This driver supports both the AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 chipsets, and
    replaces the older and less efficient spad driver (which only supported
    the AIC-6260 chipset).  You can type defbootstr link disable=spad at the
    boot prompt to disable the spad driver in the installation kernel.


 Advanced Micro Devices host adapter driver (ams)

    This is a PCSCSI(TM) 2.3.0 BTLD which provides fixes to limitations with
    previous releases of this driver.

    This driver is compatible with any of the following AMD devices:

    PCSCSI (part number Am53C974)

    PCSCSI II (part number Am53C974A)

    PCnet*-SCSI(TM) (part number Am79C970)


 DPT SCSI host adapter driver update with RAID, multi-channel, wide SCSI and
 PCI support (dptr)

    This driver updates the dptr SCSI host adapter driver and adds multi-
    channel, wide SCSI and PCI support.

    The SCO DPT RAID driver (dptr) will support all SmartCache III products,
    SmartCache Plus products, and SmartRAID products. For technical support,
    upgrades, purchases, or product information, you can contact DPT at (407)
    830-5522 in the US.

    Currently there is a curses version of Storage Manager available for the
    SCO OpenServer system that will allow you to configure and monitor your
    RAID system. This is obtainable direct from DPT.  If you want to install
    the SCO OpenServer system, you will have to create the RAID system first
    by running Storage Manager for DOS.  Once you have configured your RAID
    system using Storage Manager, you can add RAID to an existing system or
    install RAID on a new system using the dptr driver.


 EIDE and ATAPI CD-ROM (wd)

    This BTLD provides support for MP and MicroChannel systems, and for ATAPI
    CD-ROM. It replaces the ATAPI BTLD on the SCO OpenServer Release
    Supplement.

    Note that if you do not have a DPT RAID in your system, you should type
    defbootstr ahslink=wd disable=dptr at the boot prompt.  This is because
    the DPT driver can have an adverse affect on some IDE chipsets.


 IBM Fixed Disk Adapter/A (esdi)

    This driver is for MicroChannel machines only.

    The installation will fail when it tries to link the kernel.  Type i to
    ignore this, and continue. When you reboot, put the boot diskette in, and
    type hd(40)unix.install ahslink=esdi btld=fd(60).  Then you go into
    system maintenance mode and edit the line in /etc/conf/pack.d/hd/space.c:

    extern nodev();

    to read

    extern nodev(), nulldev;

    The installation will then succeed. You will need to relink the kernel.


 Symbios Logic (bhba)

    BTLDPCI-3.04.ME is a boot-time loadable driver that is link-edited into
    the SCO OpenServer kernel.  This BTLD supports the 8xx family of Symbios
    Logic SCSI controllers, specifically the 53C810, 810A, 815, 825, 825A,
    860 and 875.  This driver dynamically maps interrupts, supports Fast and
    Wide SCSI, scatter/gather, and multiple host bus adapters (HBAs).  In
    addition, this driver fully supports either single or multiple processor
    systems (multiple processor systems must also have the SCO Symmetrical
    Multiprocessing Support package installed).

    New features of this driver are:

    +  Supports Multiple Processors

    +  Negotiates for Fast 20 devices (860 & 875)


 Hardware requirements

    This SCO UNIX BTLD works with all Symbios Logic 53c8xx SCSI I/O
    Processors.  The 53C810, 815 and 825 are fully supported.  The 53C810A
    and 825A are supported in legacy mode of 53C810 and 825, respectively.
    The Fast20 negotiation feature of the 53C860 and 875 are also supported.
    The SCRIPTs RAM operation of the 53C825A and 875 are not currently
    supported.

    After installation, if additional Symbios Logic SCSI host bus adapters
    are added to the system, use the appropriate mkdev command for each
    device attached to the new host bus adapter.  After this has been done,
    the kernel has to be rebuilt, and the system needs to be rebooted for the
    change to take effect.

 Software requirements

    This driver fully supports either single or multiple processor systems
    (multiple processor systems must also have the SCO Symmetrical
    Multiprocessing Support package installed).

 Known problems

    Shutting off power to an active CD-ROM drive may hang the shell which is
    utilizing the CD-ROM.

    There is a known problem which will cause a system hang if a disk drive
    capable of Fast-20 operation is attached to a Symbios Logic host bus
    adapter containing a SCSI chip that is not capable of Fast-20 operation.
    The Symbios Logic chips which support Fast-20 operation are the 53c860
    and 53c875.  This deficiency has been identified and will be corrected in
    a later version of the Driver.

    This driver defaults to not issuing Queue Tag messages to any SCSI
    devices, since at least one SCSI disk drive with a certain firmware level
    exhibits problems during high I/O operations with Queue Tagging.  The
    driver does implement Queue Tagging.  If QueueTagging is desired, an
    administrator can edit the file /etc/conf/pack.d/bhba/space.c, change the
    bhba_do_tagged to 1 (near the end of the file), link edit the kernel and
    reboot the system.  Some increase in I/O speed has been observed but this
    change should be implemented in a non-critical system until the SCSI
    devices are proven to correctly implement Queue Tagging.

    This driver defaults to not implementing an OS feature known as
    "do_buffer".  A system hang occurs on multiprocessor systems during
    bootup.  It is advised that this feature remain OFF until the driver
    problem is corrected in a later version.


 SCSI juke box driver (Sjk)

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  This driver should be installed using the Software Manager.
       It is not boot-time loadable.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    The Sjk driver supports media changer or ``juke box'' devices.  These
    allow the selection of a data medium (such as a tape or CD) from a
    carousel, tape holder or magazine containing similar data media. This is
    then transported to an embedded SCSI device for reading or writing, and
    finally replaced in the magazine.  These devices are useful for remote
    and unattended mass data storage, retrieval, or backup purposes, where a
    single data medium could not contain enough data for the task required.

    This driver supports juke boxes which implement the SCSI-2 Medium Changer
    model definition. This is a set of SCSI commands which control the
    selection of media from the magazine and transport to and from the SCSI
    drive that reads and writes the data.  Refer to the juke(C) manual page
    for a description of SCSI-2 Medium Changer model.

 Configuring a SCSI juke box

    Before running the mkdev juke program, refer to the juke box
    documentation to find out how embedded SCSI devices (referred to as the
    data transfer elements) and the other parts of the juke box should be
    configured for their SCSI addresses (host adapter, bus number, ID, and
    LUN).

    Typically, simple juke box devices, containing one SCSI data transfer
    element such as a CD-ROM, would be configured with the same host adapter,
    SCSI ID, and bus number, as the juke box.  However, the SCSI device would
    have a SCSI LUN (logical unit number) of 0, and the juke box would have a
    SCSI LUN of 1.

    First configure each of the embedded SCSI data transfer elements using
    the appropriate mkdev scripts (for example, mkdev tape for tape, mkdev
    cdrom for CD-ROM).  Defer relinking the kernel.  Then configure the juke
    box device using mkdev juke, and relink and reboot the kernel.

 Juke box operation

    Refer to the juke box's documentation for details of the drive and
    mechanisms that it contains, and how it transfers media to and from
    magazines to the embedded drives. You should also read the juke(C) manual
    page and familiarize yourself with the terminology used there.

    Each juke box configured with mkdev juke is associated with a control
    device node. The device node is named /dev/SjkN, where N takes a value
    from 0 to 255.  Use the included juke(C) command to control movement of
    media inside the juke box.

    Use the normal device nodes for the embedded SCSI data transfer elements
    to control, read or write to the currently selected data media.

    The following example is based on a system containing a juke box with two
    SCSI DAT tape drives as data transfer elements, eight storage elements,
    two medium transport elements, and one import/export element.

    Two SCSI tape drives were first configured using mkdev tape.

       /dev/rStp0    /dev/nrStp0    /dev/xStp0
       /dev/rStp1    /dev/nrStp1    /dev/xStp1

    This created rewind, non-rewind and control devices for the first and
    second tape drives:  tape(C) and backup commands such as cpio(C), tar(C),
    dd(C), can be used to access and control these devices assuming that they
    have data media loaded.

    The juke box was configured using mkdev juke.  This created the device
    node /dev/Sjk0. The juke(C) command is used with this device. The
    available elements on the device can be displayed using the juke elem
    command.

       Valid elements for device /dev/Sjk0:
       Import/Export Elements:     ie0
       Medium Transport Elements:  mt0 mt1
       Storage Elements:               st0 st1 st2 st3 st4 st5 st6 st7
       Data Transfer Elements:         dt0 dt1

    In this listing, dt0 refers to the first SCSI DAT tape, mt1 is the second
    medium transport mechanism, and st1 is the second slot in a tape
    magazine.

    Assuming that each storage element contains a DAT tape, the following
    procedure will read from the DAT tape in the second storage element.
    First move the tape from the second storage element (st1) to one of the
    medium transport elements (mt0);

       juke move st1 mt0

    Next place the DAT tape into one of the DAT drives (dt0) by moving the
    medium transport element to the DAT drive.

       juke move mt0 dt0

    This has the effect of loading the tape into the drive; The tape can be
    read from or written to the drive using the /dev/rStp0 device node.

    Once finished, the DAT tape can be replaced back in its slot using the
    commands:

       juke move dt0 mt0
       juke move mt0 st1

    Note that the tape is usually replaced from where it came, although you
    could place it in another free slot.  To replace the media in the second
    storage element (st1), move it to the import/export element;

       juke move st1 ie0

    The DAT tape can then be taken out of the tape loader or access panel and
    replaced. To place the new media in the second storage element:

       juke move ie0 st1

    Simpler devices without import/export elements or media transport
    elements may operate as follows.  To move the media in the second storage
    element to the first drive:

       juke move st1 dt0

    To move it back again:

       juke move dt0 st1


 Tricord 4-bus (iiop)

    This BTLD is used to install machines configured with an Intelligent I/O
    Processor Board (IIOP), an Enhanced IIOP (EIIOP) with  PowerRAID or an
    Intelligent Storage Subsystem (ISS) with PowerRAID.  This BTLD supports
    the following PowerFrame  models:

    +  PowerFrame  Models 30/40

    +  PowerFrame  Models 300/400

    +  PowerFrame  Models ES3000/4000/5000

    Throughout these release notes the term SCSI controller will be used to
    reference the IIOP, EIIOP, or ISS.

    The IIOP and EIIOP controller boards control two SCSI buses. The ISS
    controller board controls two or four SCSI buses depending on the model.

    IIOP/EIIOP SCSI subsystem

    The IIOP/EIIOP manages two SCSI buses, numbered 0 and 1.  On each SCSI
    bus, the IIOP itself reserves ID 0; therefore, SCSI IDs 1 through 7 may
    be used for devices. One IIOP/EIIOP can support a maximum of 14 SCSI
    devices.  The IIOP/EIIOP driver can support a maximum of 2 IIOPs/EIIOPs
    (numbered 0 and 1) and therefore a maximum of 28 SCSI devices. An
    additional IIOP or EIIOP can be added to your system by configuring the
    additional board with the EISA Configuration Utility.  The IIOP/EIIOP
    driver will automatically recognize the new board when the system is
    booted. You cannot mix IIOPs and EIIOPs in the same machine. If you are
    installing two IIOP/EIIOPs in a machine, they must have the same firmware
    revision number.  IIOP/EIIOPs and ISSs cannot co-exist in the same
    machine.

    ISS SCSI subsystem

    The ISS manages two or four SCSI buses, depending on the model.  These
    buses are numbered  0 and 1 or 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  On each SCSI
    bus, the ISS itself reserves ID 0; therefore, SCSI IDs 1 through 7 may be
    used for devices.  The maximum number of  ISSs that can be configured
    into your ES3000/4000/5000 depends on the number of available system
    slots.  Additional ISS boards can be added to your system using the EISA
    configuration utility. The ISS driver will automatically recognize the
    new board when the system is booted. Multiple ISSs in the same machine
    must have the same firmware revision number. The firmware revision can be
    determined by booting the PowerRAID diskette. IIOP/EIIOPs and ISSs cannot
    co-exist in the same machine.

 Using the iiop BTLD diskette

    The BTLD diskette is used to link the IIOP/EIIOP/ISS driver into the SCO
    OpenServer kernel during installation.

    The default configuration expected on a Tricord PowerFrame is a hard disk
    configured on SCSI controller 0, bus 0, with SCSI ID 1.  Mirroring of the
    boot drive is allowed if you have an EIIOP or ISS SCSI controller. Check
    your hardware manuals and the Release Notes for more information.

    To install  using the BTLD:

    1.  Familiarize yourself with installation procedures covered in the SCO
        OpenServer Handbook.

    2.  If you wish to mirror your boot drive, boot the system using the
        PowerRAID Administrator diskette and create a mirrored boot drive.
        Installation on logical drives is allowed.  Logical identifier 0 will
        always represent the boot drive.

    3.  The installation device (cartridge tape or CD-ROM) may be configured
        on a secondary controller such as an Adaptec 2740.  The BIOS for
        these controllers must be disabled using the EISA configuration
        utility.  Do not put hard drives on a secondary controller as the
        kernel will get confused about the boot controller and panic the
        system. You can use tapes and CD-ROMs on a secondary controller
        without any problem.

    4.  Insert the boot diskette and reboot the machine.

    5.  At the boot prompt (Boot:) type link and press <Enter>.

    6.  When asked to enter the package name type iiop and any other package
        you need to link at boot-time, and press <Enter>, regardless of which
        SCSI controller is present.

    7.  Follow the installation instructions.


 Fresh installation

    A fresh installation of SCO OpenServer Release 5 is the only installation
    type supported by this BTLD.  If you are upgrading from a SCO(r) UNIX(r)
    Release 3.2v4 system to SCO OpenServer Release 5 and you would like to
    take advantage of the new High Throughput File System (HTFS(TM)), you
    must save your filesystem data to tape or another backup media and
    restore them to the new filesystems after they are created. If you are
    currently using the U/FT RAID 1 product, refer to ``Upgrading U/FT RAID 1
    mirrors''.

    If you wish to retain your current AFS or EAFS filesystems you can move
    your hard drives intact to your SCO OpenServer Release 5 system. The
    following procedure will work for physical drives or logical drives
    created with the PowerRAID utility:

    1.  Create configuration entries for your drive(s) under SCO OpenServer
        Release 5 by using the mkdev utility hd_iiop.  The first time the
        utility is run, an entry is created in the file /etc/conf/cf.d/mscsi.
        Do not create these entries by editing the mscsi file.  You must use
        mkdev hd_iiop.

    2.  Relink the kernel, and reboot the system.

    3.  Now run mkdev hd_iiop for the second time to create a device node for
        the drive. You will see the following message displayed on the
        console:

           During installation you may choose to overwrite all
           or part of the present contents of your hard disk

           Do you wish to continue (y/n)

        Answer `y' to this question to preserve the disk's contents.  You
        will see the following message displayed on the console:

           The hard disk installation program will now invoke /etc/fdisk.
           Entering 'q' at the following menu will exit /etc/fdisk,
           and the hard disk installation will continue.

           If you wish to exit the entire installation at this menu,
           press the <DEL> key

                1). Display Partition Table
                2). Use Entire Disk for UNIX
                3). Use Rest of Disk for UNIX
                4). Create UNIX Partition
                5). Activate Partition
                6). Delete Partition
                7). Create Partition

           Enter your choice or `q' to quit:

        There should already be a partition table on your hard disk, so enter
        `q'.  You will then see the following message displayed on the
        console:

           Choose one of the following options below or quit

              `y' to create a division table on the active partition
              `n' to avoid creating a division table

           Enter `y', `n' or `q' to quit:

        There should already be a division table defined for this drive so
        answer `y' to this question and the division table will be displayed
        on the system console. Name the divisions that have filesystems on
        them. Do not create new filesystems on any  divisions that contain
        valid data.  After naming the divisions, enter `q' to quit.  Install
        the division table by entering `i' at the next menu.

    4.  Installing the division table creates block and character device
        nodes in /dev for your divisions. You can now create filesystem mount
        entries in /etc/default/filesys by running the utility mkdev fs on
        the Filesystem Manager.

    Using the Software Manager after a BTLD installation

    We recommend that you do not install using the Software Manager after the
    BTLD installation. If you do use the Software Manager, your kernel relink
    will fail, and you will need to  follow the steps below. You will not be
    able to remove the driver subsequently.

    When you see the message:

    Driver <driver name> is already installed.
    Do you want to overwrite the installed driver (note: it will
    not be backed up)?"

    Answer no for each of the drivers in the Tricord package. If you do not,
    it will not be possible to relink the kernel.

    If the kernel relink fails:

    1.  Switch to another multiscreen.

    2.  Enter


        cp /var/opt/K/SCO/OS_drivers/perm_save_dir/tpic/space.c
        /etc/conf/pack.d/pic/space.c.


    3.  Switch to the original multiscreen to proceed with the installation.

    4.  Type r to retry the kernel link and finish the installation.


    Upgrading U/FT RAID 1 mirrors

    The U/FT RAID 1 product is not supported under SCO OpenServer. SCO now
    supports a Virtual Disk Manager product that includes the functionality
    of U/FT RAID and much more. The virtual disk system is incompatible with
    disk divisions created with divvy,  meaning that existing filesystems
    cannot be directly used with the virtual disk product.  If you have
    filesystem data that resides on a U/FT mirror and you intend to restore
    the data to a virtual disk RAID device, save the filesystem data to a
    backup device and restore it to the virtual disk RAID after it is
    created.

 SCSI configuration viewing utility

    The rview utility provides a visual representation of SCSI devices
    attached to the SCSI controller.  To run rview:

       /usr/bin/rview


 Adding SCSI devices

    The SCO OpenServer Release 5 BTLD diskette contains modified mkdev
    scripts for configuring SCSI devices on a Tricord SCSI controller.  Use
    mkdev hd_iiop for configuring disk devices, mkdev tape_iiop for
    configuring tape devices and mkdev cdrom_iiop for configuring Compact
    disk devices. These mkdev scripts use the SCSI configuration viewing
    utility (rview) to display SCSI devices for selection.

 Kernel message logging daemon (imsd)

    This release of the BTLD includes a  message logging daemon, imsd. This
    daemon provides the following major functions:

    +  Generic, high speed, kernel message logging.

    +  Management Console remote shutdown (for systems configured with an
       Intelligent Management Subsystem).

    imsd is started up when the system enters multiuser mode.  If for any
    reason this daemon is killed when in multiuser mode, it can be restarted
    by entering:

       /bin/sh  /etc/idrc.d/ims


 Remote console feature

    For systems configured with an Intelligent Management Subsystem, the
    Management Console software supports a remote console window.  All output
    to the console will appear on this Management Console window.  The last
    4KB of console output are buffered by the Intelligent Management
    Processor and are available when the remote console window is brought up.

    The remote console window also supports limited functionality for issuing
    shell commands. Since the window emulates a dumb terminal, no UNIX
    commands requiring ANSI terminal support can be successfully issued (for
    example vi). Since this interface provides a direct pipeline into console
    input and output, system administrators with security concerns may wish
    to disallow any input from this Management Console window.

    Both input and output to this window are configurable by modifying
    variables in the file /etc/conf/pack.d/ims/space.c according to the
    following bit defines, and relinking:

    IMS_REMOTE_CON_KIN 1 /* Bit 0 */
            If set to a 1 (default), kernel input is enabled.  If set to a 0,
            kernel input is disabled.

    IMS_REMOTE_CON_KOUT 2 /* Bit 1 */
            If set to a 2 (default), then all kernel output is forwarded to
            the Management Console. This includes all system error messages.
            If set to 0 then no output generated by the kernel will be
            forwarded to the Management Console.

    IMS_REMOTE_CON_UIN 4 /* Bit 2 */
            If set to a 4 (default), then all input from the Management
            Console will be forwarded to the operating system for processing.
            Since this is the mechanism for logging into the operating system
            from the Management Console setting this to a 0 will disable the
            issuing of all administration commands.

    IMS_REMOTE_CON_UOUT 8 /* Bit 3 */
            If set to a 8 (default), then all console output originating from
            the operating system will be forwarded to the remote Management
            Console. If set to 0, then all process level console output will
            not be sent to the management console.

    The remote console window also supports an option for local echo. A
    suggested setting for local echo is off if running the debugger and on
    when not in the debugger.




 Chapter 7
 Multiprocessing drivers: notes and known limitations

    This chapter documents the SCO(r) Multiprocessing Drivers component of
    the Advanced Hardware Supplement Release 5.1.0.  This component contains
    the driver for the Tricord PowerFrame (TPF) platform.

    After some introductory notes on installation, this chapter contains
    notes about the Tricord driver.


 Installation requirements

    Before installing the multiprocessing component, you must have the SCO
    OpenServer system installed with SCO Symmetrical Multiprocessing Support
    (SMP(r)) (this product can be found on the original installation media
    tape or CD-ROM and accessed via the Software Manager).  The iiop BTLD
    package must also be installed and configured.  If it is not, the MP
    component will be installed but the TPF driver will be disabled.  In this
    case, install the iiop package, and then enable the TPF driver by setting
    the second field of /etc/conf/sdevice.d/tpf  from N to Y.

    You can install on one of the following configurations:

    +  A clean distribution (SCO OpenServer and no MP drivers).

    +  A distribution which already has a vendor EFS (it is not generally
       necessary to remove the EFS prior to installing the SCO Multi-
       processing Drivers Release 5.1.0).

    The AHS Multiprocessing Drivers component can be removed and any vendor
    EFS/SCO OpenServer files will be restored (if you want to save them).


 Installation procedure

    To install the AHS Multiprocessing Drivers component on your system,
    follow the steps in Chapter 1, ``Installing the AHS 5.1.0 software''


 Removal procedure

    To remove the AHS Multiprocessing Drivers component from your system,
    follow the steps in ``Removing the AHS software''


 Tricord

    This version of the AHS supports the following PowerFrame models:

    +  PowerFrame Models 30/40

    +  PowerFrame Models 300/400

    +  PowerFrame Models ES3000/4000/5000

    You need to remove any previous Tricord EFS prior to installing.

    When you install the TPF package, you will automatically disable the a15k
    driver.  If you have a Tricord box this does not affect you and may cause
    problems if it was not disabled.  If you have any machine that uses the
    a15k driver (the ACER FRAME 15000/17000), you should either reenable the
    a15k driver, or remove the TPF package. If you are not running on a
    Tricord machine, there is no problem having both enabled.




 juke(C)                                                       28 August 1995


 Name

    juke - operate a SCSI media changer

 Syntax

    juke operation [device]

 Description

    The juke utility sends a command to a SCSI media changer (or ``juke
    box'') device to move data media between its various elements.  The
    device argument defaults to /dev/Sjk0, the first media changer defined in
    the system.

    Supported operations are:

    elem List the internal elements of the media changer.  (The SCSI-2 media
         changer model defines four physical parts, or ``elements'', for juke
         box devices.  The physical configuration of these elements should be
         defined in the hardware manual supplied with the device.)

         The elem operation displays elements using the following codes:

         dtN  Data transfer element; an embedded SCSI peripheral device (such
              as a tape or CD-ROM drive) which is capable of reading or
              writing a data medium.  Medium changer devices normally contain
              one or more data transfer elements.

         ieN  Import/export element; a special storage location where a human
              operator or another media changer can insert or remove a data
              medium via an access door or external loader mechanism.  A
              media transport element moves data media between an
              import/export element and storage elements and data transfer
              elements which are usually not accessible externally.  A media
              changer device may have zero or more import/export elements.

         mtN  Medium transport element; a robotic mechanism which moves data
              media between storage elements, data transfer elements, and
              import/export elements.  If a media changer device defines one
              or more media transport elements, these may be used as
              temporary holding places for data media.  If a media changer
              device does not define a media transport element, data media
              are transferred directly between storage elements and data
              transfer elements.

         stN  Storage element; a location or ``slot'' in a carousel, tape
              holder or magazine which can contain a data medium.  It is not
              a data medium (such as a tape or a CD).  Medium changer devices
              typically contain four or more storage elements.

         N is a number from 0 to 255 representing different elements of a
         given type within a media changer device.  If no entries are shown
         for an element type, the media changer does not contain such an
         element.

    lock Disable the front panel controls of the media changer.

    move source destination
         Move data medium from a source element to a destination element.

    pos stN
         Position medium transport element ``mt0'' in front of ``stN''.  This
         places the media transport ready to retrieve a data medium from the
         specified storage element.  It does not transfer any data medium to
         the media transport.

    reset
         Perform a hardware reset on the media changer.

    unlock
         Enable the front panel controls of the media changer.

    Configuration

    Each data transfer element is configured and operated as a separate SCSI
    peripheral device.  Storage, data transfer, and import/export elements
    are configured and operated as part of the media changer device.

    For example, a juke box containing one SCSI CD-ROM drive (the data
    transfer element) is configured as two entities:

    +  A CD-ROM drive using the mkdev cdrom command.  If this is the first
       such device configured in the system, its block and character device
       nodes are /dev/cd0 and /dev/rcd0.

    +  A media changer device using the mkdev juke command.  If this is the
       first such device configured in the system, its control device node is
       /dev/Sjk0.

    Data transfer elements usually have the same SCSI host adapter name, bus
    number, and ID as the other elements in the juke box, but their LUNs
    (logical unit numbers) differ.  For example, the LUNs of the data
    transfer element and the media changer device may be 0 and 1
    respectively.

    Refer to the documentation supplied with the juke box for details of the
    SCSI configuration of its elements.

 Name

    jukebox: juke, Sjk - media changer devices

 Description

    Sjk is the SCSI peripheral driver for media changer devices (juke boxes).

    The command mkdev juke is used to configure the media changer driver
    interactively. This defines the SCSI host adapter, bus number, controller
    target ID, and device LUN in the SCSI configuration file mscsi(F).  The
    data transfer elements of a media changer (for example, DAT or CD-ROM
    drive) must be defined as separate SCSI peripherals using an appropriate
    command such as mkdev tape or mkdev cdrom.

    The juke command can be used to control a media changer device.  See
    juke(C) for more information.

    The device file /dev/SjkN may be used to control the associated media
    changer device.  N corresponds to the minor number of the device.  The
    minor device number determines which media changer will be accessed;
    minor number 0 accesses the first device, 1 the second device and so on,
    up to minor number 255.

    ioctl commands

    The following ioctl(S) commands, defined in /usr/include/sys/Sjk.h, may
    be used to control a media changer (the argument arg to ioctl is set to 0
    unless otherwise indicated):

    SJK_GETJUKEADDR
         Return the details of the media changer's internal elements in the
         struct Sjk_address pointed to by arg.

    SJK_MOVEJUKE
         Move a data medium (tape, CD) from a source storage element to a
         destination storage element.  The argument arg is coded as:

         (source << 16) | destination

         where source and destination are of type unsigned short.

    SJK_NOJUKEREMOVE
         Disable the front panel controls of the media changer.

    SJK_OKJUKEREMOVE
         Enable the front panel controls of the media changer.

    SJK_POSITIONJUKE
         Position medium transport element ``mt0'' in front of storage
         element ``stN'', where N is the value of arg of type unsigned int.

    SJK_RESET
         Perform a hardware reset on the media changer.

 Diagnostics

    The following SCSI sense error messages may be displayed on the console.
    See messages(M) for general information about kernel error messages,
    including a list of generic device driver errors.

    NOTICE: Sjk: Destination Element Full

    A data medium could not be placed in a given element because that element
    was already occupied.

    NOTICE: Sjk: Invalid CDB Field

    A SCSI command data block field was not understood by the media changer's
    controller.

    NOTICE: Sjk: Invalid Command Code

    A SCSI command was not understood by the media changer's controller.

    NOTICE: Sjk: Invalid Element Address

    A specified element was not found to be present in the media changer.

    NOTICE: Sjk: Logical Unit Not Supported

    A SCSI command addressed a non-existent element of the media changer.

    NOTICE: Sjk: Manual Intervention Required

    A hardware error occurred in the media changer which requires the
    intervention of a human operator.

    NOTICE: Sjk: Mechanical problem

    A hardware failure occurred in the media changer.

    NOTICE: Sjk: Media Removal Prevented

    A data medium could not be removed from a specified element because of a
    physical obstruction.

    NOTICE: Sjk: Power-on Reset, or Bus Reset

    A hardware reset was performed on the media changer.

    NOTICE: Sjk: Source Element Empty

    A data medium could not be removed from a given element because it was
    not present there.
