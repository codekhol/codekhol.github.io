Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx347a provides a SCSI Badblock 
Utility called scsibadblk(ADM).  This utility is similar in functionality to 
badtrk(ADM), but must only be used to detect or replace badblocks on SCSI 
diskettes.

SLS unx347a will install the scsibadblk(ADM) utility, and a man page for
the utility, onto your system.

SLS unx347a will only install on SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating
System Version 2.0 and SCO Open Desktop Release 1.1.x.

SLS unx347a is custom(ADM) installable and removable and consists of a single
floppy volume.
