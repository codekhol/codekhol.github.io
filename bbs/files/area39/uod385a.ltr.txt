Dear SCO Customer,

The Connection Drivers Support Level Supplement (SLS) UOD385A resolves
several problems in regard to file system connectivity and network data
transfer issues for Microsoft LAN Manager for UNIX Systems Release 2.2.0
(hereafter referred to simply as LAN Manager). 

It is highly recommended that SLS UOD385A and the Microsoft LAN Manager 
for UNIX Systems Server Maintenance Supplement 2.2.1 be applied to the 
LAN Manager 2.2.0 server.  Doing so will provide the best possible 
environment and will bring the LAN Manager server software to revision 
level 2.2.1. 

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) UOD385A contains drivers 
for the following products:

SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.1 and 4.2
SCO Open Desktop Release 2.0 and 3.0
SCO Open Desktop Lite Release 3.0
SCO Open Server Network System Release 3.0
SCO Open Server Enterprise System Release 3.0

SLS UOD385A contains the following:

1. A new /etc/conf/pack.d/s5/Driver.o file.  An updated /etc/conf/pack.d/.
   s5/space.c file is also installed on SCO Open Desktop 2.0 and SCO UNIX
   Operating System Version 4.1.  The update to this driver addresses silent
   corruption of files, when written from the application on the client to 
   the network drive on the server.  An application that holds the target 
   file open and issues a chsize(S) call to change the size of the file is 
   subject to this problem.  This issue has been reported by users of 
   Microsoft MSWORKS, Microsoft Excel and Lotus 123.

2. A new /etc/conf/pack.d/sp/Driver.o and /etc/conf/pack.d/sp/space.c file.
   Updates to this driver essentially remove a minor deadlock situation that
   is manifested by: (1) server hangs under extremely heavy data transfer;
   (2) intermittent failures when copying multiple files (copy *.*) between
   the server and a workstation; (3) failures by the server to validate work-
   station net logon attempts.

3. A new /etc/conf/pack.d/hs/Driver.o file.  Updates to this driver correct
   an intermittent problem with mounted high-sierra file systems on the LAN
   Manager server. The LAN Manager workstation is unable to report the
   existence of directories.  This problem is seen when the directory files
   '.'  and '..' have the same inode number.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS AND NOTES
-----------------------------------

It is recommended that the Microsoft LAN Manager for UNIX Systems Server
Maintenance Supplement 2.2.1 be installed first, followed by SLS UOD385A.
You may postpone relinking of the kernel until installation of the SLS.  
This will avoid an unnecessary second relinking of the kernel.

The /etc/conf/pack.d/s5/Driver.o file supplied with SLS UOD385A is not 
compatible with the same driver supplied in SLS UOD381A.  It is NOT safe 
to install SLS UOD385A and SLS UOD381A on the same machine.  Installation 
of SLS UOD385A on a machine running SYBASE with SLS UOD381A will violate 
the integrity of the SYBASE level 10 environment.

The /etc/conf/pack.d/s5/Driver.o file supplied with SLS UOD385A is not XPG4
compliant.

At this time, it is necessary for a customer to choose between installing
SLS UOD385A and strict XPG4 compliance, they cannot have both.  This will 
be corrected in a future release of SLS UOD385.       


To install SLS UOD385A, take the following steps:

1. Shutdown and reboot your system.  Enter System Maintenance 
   mode by typing your root password at the prompt:

   Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
   (or give root password for System Maintenance)

2. Type:

   /etc/custom

3. The main custom "menu" will appear.  The "Install" option will
   be highlighted.  Press <Return> to select the "Install" option.

4. A list of installed products will appear.  The first item in 
   the list, "A New Product", is highlighted.  Press <Return> 
   to select "A New Product".

5. Custom will now display your installation options.  By default,
   "Entire Product" is highlighted.  Press <Return> to select
   "Entire Product".

6. Custom will prompt you to insert "Distribution Floppy 1".  Insert
   the enclosed diskette into the drive and press <Return> while 
   "Continue" is highlighted.

7. After extracting some information from the diskette, custom 
   will display information indicating that it is saving several 
   files.  Custom will once again prompt you to insert volume 1.
   Press <Return> while "Continue" is highlighted.

8. You will be prompted:

   "Do you wish to relink the kernel now? (y/n)"

   Enter "y" at this prompt.

9. After the relink of the kernel is complete, you will be
   prompted:

   "Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n)"

   Enter "y" at this prompt.

10. Next, you will be prompted:

    "Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)"

    Enter "y" at this prompt.

11. After the kernel environment has been rebuilt, custom will 
    prompt you to "Press any key to continue".  Press <Return>.  
    Custom will then display the message:

    "Checking file permissions...".

12. After completing these steps, you will be returned to the
    main custom menu.  You may quit out of custom at this time. 
    To reboot the system so that the changes take effect, type:

    /etc/reboot


It should never become necessary to remove this SLS.  However, should
you need to do so, remove the SLS while in System Maintenance mode. 
Enter the command:

      /etc/custom

Choose the menu selections:

      Remove -> UOD385A: Connection Drivers SLS -> ALL

Follow the directions displayed on the screen to remove the SLS.


During both the installation and removal of this SLS, you are asked to
relink the kernel.  If you should choose not to do so during the installation
or removal process, execute the following commands at a later time while in 
System Maintenance mode:

        cd /etc/conf/cf.d
        ./link_unix

To complete installation or removal of this SLS, answer "y" to the questions 
presented and then reboot your system with the command:

        /etc/reboot
