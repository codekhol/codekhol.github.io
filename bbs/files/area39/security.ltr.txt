           SCO Security Bulletin 95:02a : SCO RESPONSE TO SATAN
           ----------------------------------------------------

                             April 13, 1995


The following statement is an official response by SCO to the release of 
SATAN 1.0.  It is SCO's second Security Bulletin this year (95:02a), and
is made to directly address issues contained in CERT Advisory CA-95:06 
on SATAN.

==========================================================================
SCO Security Bulletin 95:02a

SCO response to CERT Advisory CA-95:06, 
"Security Administrator Tools for Analyzing Networks (SATAN)"

The information in the advisory from the Computer Emergency Response
Team (CERT) contained herein has prompted attention recently in the
media and throughout the Internet Community. This article offers 
a response to SATAN from The Santa Cruz Operation.



I. Concerns about SATAN

The wide availability and ease of use of the SATAN software makes it
imperative that network administrators become aware of the issues
surrounding the security of their networks, whether or not these
networks are connected to the Internet.  While SATAN poses no new
technical issues, the ability to easily probe the network for previously
published vulnerabilities makes SATAN a serious issue for network
administrators. 

Prior to the release of SATAN, a user with malicious intent would have to
know the details of a particular vulnerability in order to take advantage
of it at a particular site. With SATAN, novice users can probe the network
for these vulnerabilities and list possible avenues of attack on a 
system-by-system basis without having to know the technical details of 
each issue.

While SATAN can be used to help discover the relative security issues
inherent in one's own network, it can also be used to scan for security faults
on other networks not in one's own control.  The possible consequences
of such a scan are what is of most concern.  SATAN users should be careful
not to probe networks outside of their control, since this type of activity
is obviously against network etiquette.


II. SCO Vulnerabilities and Corresponding Fixes

The CERT advisory below discusses several vulnerabilities that SATAN
makes an active attempt to discover.  However, there are only two 
vulnerabilities known to be inherent to SCO system software.  These are
described below:

1) If you are running the sendmail mail transfer agent on your SCO system 
instead of the default Multi-Channel Memorandum Distribution Facility (MMDF) 
system, then the sendmail vulnerability, mentioned in section 4 of the 
CERT advisory will apply to you:

    6.Sendmail vulnerabilities
      See CERT advisory CA-95:05 and CA-95:05.README for the latest information
      CERT has published about sendmail. 

This sendmail vulnerability has been addressed in (S)upport (L)evel
(S)upplement (SLS) NET382e, which is available for download (see section IV
below).

2) Additionally, the following advisory

             CA-94:02.REVISED.SunOS.rpc.mountd.vulnerability

may be relevant to a few people who use NFS (the issue pertains to lines
over 255 characters long in the /etc/exports file). A properly configured
firewall provides a layer of protection against this. Nevertheless, SCO 
has created an SLS to address this issue, NET398a, which is available 
for download (see section IV below).

The rest of the vulnerabilities listed in the advisory either represent
issues that do not exist on SCO systems or are a result of improper 
configurations. Some pertinent configuration issues are discussed
below.  See the advisory and its references for other important details.



III. Additional Security Concerns and Corresponding Fixes, Recommendations

1) Other Available Security-Related Fixes

While SATAN currently is not known to probe for security issues relating
only to SCO systems, SCO recommends the installation of the following
(S)upport (L)evel (S)upplements to protect against known SCO security
issues:

SLS ODA377a, "System Security Enhancements for SCO Open Desktop"
SLS UOD368b, "Security Supplement"
SLS UOD392a, "System Security Enhancements"

Of course, the following SLSs, already discussed, should also be installed:

SLS NET382e, "Enhanced TCP/IP 1.2.1 Drivers" 
SLS NET398a, "NFS Supplement"


2) Configuration Issues

Below are some recommendations for SCO systems using network services
supplied by SCO but not configured and activated by default.

TFTP file access
If you activate TFTP, it is recommended that you do so in a secured area,
which contains only those files that you allow to be publicly distributed
(see comments in /etc/inetd.conf for details).  See also CERT advisory
CA-91:18 for other security measures.

anonymous FTP
When setting up anonymous FTP services, be very certain that the home
directory of the FTP user (/usr/ftp by default) is not writeable by
the ftp user.  We suggest root ownership of this directory, with a mode
of 755.  See also CERT advisory CA-93:10.

rexd access
We recommend not turning on rexd in /etc/nfs.  Also, to limit access by
rexd and other programs which may NFS-mount filesystems, avoid exporting
filesystems read/write; world-exported filesystems should never be 
read/write.  

other NFS export issues
When exporting filesystems, be certain that the list of hosts does not 
include the local system (either "localhost" or what the 'hostname' command
reports).  Also keep the list below 256 characters to avoid the /etc/exports
vulnerability discussed above, if possible.  Please see CERT advisory
CA-94:15 for further guidance.

3) Specific CERT-Recommended Tools Against SATAN

The Santa Cruz Operation has created a (T)echnical (L)ibrary (S)upplement, 
(TLS) "System Security Monitoring Tools", TLS076a, which is publicly
available for download (see section IV below).  This TLS contains much 
of the software recommended by CERT to both help thwart an unwelcome 
network attack as well as help to detect when such an attack has or 
is occuring.  The TLS contains both buildable source code and binaries 
for The SCO Open Server and Open Desktop Release 3.0 bundles, as well as 
for SCO Unix System V/386 Release 3.2 Release 4.2 with SCO TCP/IP 
Release 1.2.1.  A list of software provided follows:

	tcp_wrappers 7.2: A daemon that "wraps" itself around other
			  network service daemons such as telnetd, 
			  rlogind, and others, which checks for 
			  authorized access before allowing 
			  a request for service to proceed.

	md5:		  A checksum utility published in the Public
			  Domain by RSA Data Security. It is useful
			  for verifying the authenticity of files.

	lsof:		  A utility which displays files currently
                          open by processes on the system, including
                          TCP/IP sockets.  It is useful for monitoring
                          systems which are suspected to have been
                          compromised.

        COPS:             A set of utilities to detect common procedural 
                          errors or malicious and purposeful changes 
                          to several key UNIX subsystems.  COPS provides 
                          a wrapper which allows the convenient inclusion 
                          of other security modules.

        Tripwire:         By building a digital signature database 
                          (using from one to six state-of-the-art secure 
                          hashing functions) based on a user configurable 
                          list of key files, Tripwire has the ability to 
                          regularly compare and record changes to the
                          contents of those files.  Specifically, this 
                          would be useful for monitoring changes to 
                          setuid programs or shell scripts.

			  

The software  provided on the TLS has been built to run on the listed
platforms.  The Santa Cruz Operation has verified that the software
performs as expected, but no comprehensive testing has been done.  The
TLS provides source code for all modules so that changes to the software
can freely be made.  All original source code is freely available in the
public domain or for "free use" on the Internet. SCO makes no claim of
supportability regarding this software, and it is strictly provided only
as a courtesy to our customers. 



IV. How to acquire an SLS or TLS

V. Release of a SCO Version of SATAN

SATAN is primarily a problem discovery tool; while it can find 
vulnerabilities on remote systems, it neither offers further information on,
nor takes explicit action toward, the exploitation of those vulnerabilities.
Since it is easy-to-use, extensible, and widely available, SATAN can offer
a great deal of legitimate value to network system administration.

On the other hand, because of these same qualities, SATAN offers a wide
avenue to malicious intent; furthermore, in exploratory mode it can  
probe remote systems without deliberate user intent.  Finally, the current
SATAN version appears to have its own security vulnerabilities and
instabilities.

The Santa Cruz Operation understands the value of offering a SCO
port of SATAN in the near future, under the terms of a limited release
and availability mechanism.  However, this issue is still being 
carefully discussed and scrutinized, and SCO is not directly supplying
SATAN at this time.  Further announcements by SCO will be made promptly 
as new developments arise.

In the meantime, the attached CERT advisory will give SCO system
administrators the appropriate pointers to the currently available
versions of SATAN including full source code and build instructions.



=============================================================================
CA-95:06                        CERT Advisory
                                April 3, 1995
         Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks (SATAN)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center staff has examined beta version 0.51 of the
Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks (SATAN). This advisory
contains information based on our review of this pre-release version. When the
official release is available, we will distribute an updated advisory. SATAN
is scheduled for release on April 5, 1995, at 14:00 GMT.

1. What is SATAN?
------------------
SATAN is a testing and reporting tool that collects a variety of information
about networked hosts. The currently available documentation can be found at
         ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/security/satan_doc.tar.Z

SATAN gathers information about specified hosts and networks by examining
network services (for example, finger, NFS, NIS, ftp, and rexd).  It can then
report this data in a summary format or, with a simple rule-based system,
investigate potential security problems. Problems are described briefly and
pointers provided to patches or workarounds. In addition to reporting
vulnerabilities, SATAN gathers general network information (network topology,
network services run, types of hardware and software being used on the
network).  As described in the SATAN documentation, SATAN has an exploratory
mode that allows it to probe hosts that have not been explicitly specified.
Thus, SATAN could probe not only targeted hosts, but also hosts outside your
administrative domain.

Section 4 below lists the vulnerabilities currently probed by SATAN.


2. Potential Impact of SATAN
----------------------------
SATAN was designed as a security tool for system and network administrators.
However, given its wide distribution, ease of use, and ability to scan remote
networks, SATAN is also likely to be used to locate vulnerable hosts for
malicious reasons. It is also possible that sites running SATAN for a
legitimate purpose will accidentally scan your system via SATAN's exploratory
mode.

Although the vulnerabilities SATAN identifies are not new, the ability to
locate them with a widely available, easy-to-use tool increases the level of
threat to sites that have not taken steps to address those vulnerabilities. In
addition, SATAN is easily extensible. After it is released, modified versions
might scan for other vulnerabilities as well and might include code to
compromise systems. 


3. How to Prepare for the Release of SATAN
------------------------------------------

* Examine your systems for the vulnerabilities described below and implement
  security fixes accordingly.

* In addition to reading the advisories cited for specific vulnerabilities
  below, consult the following documents for guidance on improving the
  security of your systems:
          ftp://info.cert.org/tech_tips/security_info
          ftp://info.cert.org/tech_tips/anonymous_ftp
          ftp://info.cert.org/tech_tips/packet_filtering

* Contact your vendor for information on available security patches, and
  ensure that all patches have been installed at your site.

* Use the tools listed in Section 5 to assist you in assessing and improving
  the security of your systems.


4. Vulnerabilities Probed by SATAN
----------------------------------
Listed below are vulnerabilities that beta version 0.51 of SATAN tests for,
along with references to CERT advisories and other documents where applicable.

Administrators should verify the state of their systems and perform corrective
actions as necessary. We cannot stress enough the importance of good network
configuration and the need to install all available patches.

   1. NFS export to unprivileged programs
   2. NFS export via portmapper
   3. Unrestricted NFS export

      See CERT advisory CA-94:15 and CA-94:15.README for security measures you
      can take to address NFS vulnerabilities.

      The following advisories also address problems related to NFS:
             CA-94:02.REVISED.SunOS.rpc.mountd.vulnerability
             CA-94:02.README
             CA-93:15.SunOS.and.Solaris.vulnerabilities
             CA-92:15.Multiple.SunOS.vulnerabilities.patches
             CA-92:12.REVISED.SunOS.rpc.mountd.vulnerability
             CA-91:21.SunOS.NFS.Jumbo.and.fsirand

   4. NIS password file access
      See CERT advisory CA-92:13 for information about SunOS 4.x machines using
      NIS, and CA-93:01 for information about HP machines.

   5. rexd access
      We recommend filtering the rexd service at your firewall and commenting
      out rexd in the file /etc/inetd.conf. 
      
      See CERT advisory CA-92:05 for more information about IBM AIX machines
      using rexd, and CA-91:06 for information about NeXT.
   
   6. Sendmail vulnerabilities
      See CERT advisory CA-95:05 and CA-95:05.README for the latest information
      we have published about sendmail. 

   7. TFTP file access
      See CERT advisory CA-91:18 for security measures that address TFTP access
      problems. In addition, CA-91:19 contains information for IBM AIX users.

   8. Remote shell access
      We recommend that you comment out rshd in the file /etc/inetd.conf or
      protect it with a TCP wrapper.

   9. Unrestricted X server access
      We recommend filtering X at your firewall. Additional advice about
      packet filtering is available by anonymous FTP from
             ftp://info.cert.org:/pub/tech_tips/anonymous_ftp

   10. Writable FTP home directory
       See CERT advisory CA-93:10. 
       Guidance on anonymous FTP configuration is also available from
             ftp://info.cert.org:/pub/tech_tips/anonymous_ftp

   11. wu-ftpd vulnerability
       See CA-93:06, CA-94:07, and CA-94:07.README for more information about
       ftpd.


Note: In addition to our FTP archive at info.cert.org, CERT documents are
      available from the following sites, and others which you can locate
      by using archie:

          ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu:/pub/mirrors/cert.org/cert_advisories 
          ftp://unix.hensa.ac.uk:/pub/uunet/doc/security/cert_advisories
          ftp://ftp.luth.se:/pub/misc/cert/cert_advisories
          ftp://ftp.switch.ch:/network/security/cert_advisories
          ftp://corton.inria.fr:/CERT/cert_advisories
          ftp://ftp.inria.fr:/network/cert_advisories
          ftp://nic.nordu.net:/networking/security/cert_advisories

5. Currently Available Tools
-----------------------------
The following tools are freely available now and can help you improve your
site's security before SATAN is released.

COPS and ISS can be used to check for vulnerabilities and configuration
weaknesses. 

     COPS is available from ftp://info.cert.org:/pub/tools/cops/*

     ISS is available from
     ftp://ftp.uu.net:/usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume39/iss  
     CERT advisory CA-93:14 and CA-93:14.README contain information about ISS.

TCP wrappers can provide access control and flexible logging to most network
services. These features can help you prevent and detect network attacks. This
software is available by anonymous FTP from

          ftp://info.cert.org:/pub/tools/tcp_wrappers/*

The TAMU security package includes tools to check for vulnerabilities and
system configuration weaknesses, and it provides logging and filtering of
network services. This software is available by anonymous FTP from

          ftp://net.tamu.edu:/pub/security/TAMU/*

The Swatch log file monitor allows you to identify patterns in log file entries
and associate them with actions. This tool is available from

          ftp://ee.stanford.edu:/pub/sources/swatch.tar.Z


6. Detecting Probes
-------------------
One indication of attacks by SATAN, and other tools, is evidence of a heavy
scan of a range of ports and services in a relatively short time.  Many UNIX
network daemons do not provide sufficient logging to determine if SATAN is
probing the system. TCP wrappers, the TAMU tools, and Swatch can provide the
logging you need.


7. Using SATAN
---------------
Running SATAN on your systems will provide you with the same information an
attacker would obtain, allowing you to correct vulnerabilities. If you choose
to run SATAN, we urge you to read the documentation carefully. Also,
note the following:

* It is easy to accidentally probe systems you did not intend to. If this
  occurs, the probed site may view the probe(s) as an attack on their
  system(s).

* Take special care in setting up your configuration file, and in selecting the
  probe level when you run SATAN. 

* Explicitly bound the scope of your probes when you run SATAN. Under "SATAN
  Configuration Management," explicitly limit probes to specific hosts and
  exclude specific hosts.  

* When you run SATAN, ensure that other users do not have read access to your
  SATAN directory.

* In some cases, SATAN points to CERT advisories. If the link does not work
  for you, try getting the advisories by anonymous FTP.


8. Getting more information about SATAN
---------------------------------------
As noted above, SATAN documentation is available from
          ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/security/satan_doc.tar.Z

Additional documents are available through a mail server set up by one of the
authors. 

Send mail to
          majordomo@wzv.win.tue.nl

Put the following text in the body (not subject):
        get satan mirror-sites
        get satan release-plan
        get satan description
        get satan admin-guide-to-cracking.101

The last document contains "Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking
Into It," a 1993 paper in which the authors give their rationale for creating
SATAN.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CERT Coordination Center staff thanks Dan Farmer and Wieste Venema for the
the opportunity to examine pre-release versions of SATAN. We also appreciate
the interaction with the response teams at AUSCERT, CIAC, and DFN-CERT, and
feedback from Eric Allman.
