Dear SCO Customer, 

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) UOD376C contains a new enhanced 
SCSI tape driver which allows for reading and writing of variable block length
tapes.  This SLS applies to all current SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 
Operating System Version 4 based products (Version 4.0, Version 4.0 with
Maintenance Supplement Version 4.1 and/or 4.2 and Version 4.2) and SCO Open 
Desktop Release 2.0 and 3.0.  This variable block read and write option is 
only applicable to tape drives (greater than 150MB) which support a variable 
tape block size option.  The new driver also allows for an adjustable fixed 
length read/write.

SLS UOD376C also provides the new functionality of being able to read forward 
or backward over multiple filemarks.  See section II for further discussion
of this new functionality. 

SLS UOD376C now includes support for Exabyte SCSI tape drives.  See section 
III for a list of Exabyte tape drive model numbers that are supported with 
this SLS.

NOTE: SLS UOD376C replaces both SLS UOD376A and UOD376B.


I. Using custom(ADM) to Install or Remove SLS UOD376C

II. New Functionality


A. Variable block mode functionality

With SLS UOD376C, you will be able to read tapes with your SCSI tape drive 
that were written in variable block mode.  To enable the variable block 
functionality of the newly loaded SCSI tape driver, the tape(C) utility 
must be invoked with the -a setblk option.  

For example, to set the default SCSI tape drive on your system to variable 
block mode, type the following command:

     # tape -a 0 setblk

Where "0" indicates that no block size be set, thus enabling the variable
block mode functionality.  The size of blocks used during reads and writes 
in variable block mode is set by the utility, such as tar, cpio, or dd.  If 
reading or writing a tape in variable block mode, using read or write system
calls from within a C program, the block size must be set from within the C 
program.  Variable block mode read/write must be supported by the tape drive 
hardware.  Tape drives of 150MB capacity or less do not support this option.

Non-zero values may also be used to set the fixed block size in which the SCSI
tape drive will operate.  Non-zero values explicitly set the drive and driver 
to the block size specified on the tape -a setblk command line.  For example, 
to set the second SCSI tape drive to operate in 1024 byte block mode, type:
     
     # tape -a 1024 setblk /dev/rStp1

The above command sets the drive and driver into a fixed block mode of 
blocksize 1024 bytes. 

NOTE: The tape -a setblk commands must be issued with a rewound tape 
      loaded in the SCSI tape drive.

The tape -a setblk command remains in effect for the duration that the tape 
is in the drive, until the drive is reinitialized, or until another tape -a 
setblk command is issued.  This means that whenever a tape is placed in the 
tape drive, the drive will initialize itself to whatever its default block 
mode is.  This may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.  The appropriate 
tape -a setblk command must then be issued to set the drive to the desired 
mode. 


B. Multiple filemark read functionality

The tape command has the ability to request that multiple filemarks be read:

     tape -a <NN> rfm /dev/nrStp0

where <NN> can be positive or negative.
        
The "no rewind" device node must be used when reading filemarks, as this will 
prevent the tape drive from rewinding after positioning itself at the desired 
filemark. 

NOTE:  The first read after the reverse read filemark fails because
       reverse positioning places the current location toward the 
       beginning-of-partition.  Performing a "tape rfm" (1 filemark)
       or a "tar tv" will read the FM (filemark) immediately preceding 
       the data and properly position the tape to just after the FM 
       and before the data.

       So, if the user wanted to position back to the starting location, 
       then an _extra_ FM must be used in the reverse direction.  Then, 
       a read of a single FM will position the tape immediately after 
       the FM and before the data.

The following is taken from the SCSI specifications:

|"When spacing over blocks, filemarks, or setmarks, the count field
| specifies the number of blocks, filemarks, or setmarks to be spaced
| over in the current partition.  A positive value N in the count field
| shall cause forward positioning (toward end-of-partition) over N
| blocks, filemarks, or setmarks ending on the end-of-partition side of
| the last block, filemark, or setmark.  A zero value in the count field
| shall cause no change of logical position.  A negative value -N (two's
| complement notation) in the count field shall cause reverse positioning
| (toward beginning-of-partition) over N blocks, filemarks, or setmarks
| ending on the beginning-of-partition side of the last block, filemark,
| or setmark.  Support of spacing in the reverse direction is optional."

An example which demonstrates this follows: 

A user has a tape with 7 archives on it -- each archive consists of one 
file each.  The file on archive one is called file1, the file on archive 2 
is file2, and so on.  If the user wanted to get to the 4th archive on the 
tape, they would take the following steps:

- To make sure they are at the beginning of the tape, enter:

  # tape rewind /dev/rStp0      

- From the beginning of archive one, move forward 3 filemarks to archive 4:

  # tape -a 3 rfm /dev/nrStp0   

- Extract contents of archive 4 (tape is now at the beginning of archive 5):

  # tar xvf /dev/nrStp0         

Now, suppose that, with the tape positioned at the beginning of archive 5, 
the user wishes to view the contents of archive 2.  Since the user wants to
read backwards 3 filemarks, specify "-4", as instructed previously:

  # tape -a -4 rfm /dev/nrStp0  

- A read is required to position the tape at the beginning of data:

  # tar tvf /dev/nrStp0         

- This time, the contents of archive 2 are listed:

  # tar tvf /dev/nrStp0
