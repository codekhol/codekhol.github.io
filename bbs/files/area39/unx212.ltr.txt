Dear SCO Customer,

Enclosed is Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx212.  This SLS contains a 
device driver for the following Tecmar/Wangtek tape drive/controller 
combinations running with the SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating 
System, SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 2.0, 
Open Desktop Release 1.0, or Open Desktop Release 1.1 for computers based 
on Micro Channel Architecture (MCA).

NOTE: A copy of the reference file for this controller is included on SLS
unx212.  After installing SLS unx212, the adf file may be found in 
/ADF/@5125.adf.  Use doscp to copy this option file onto your reference disk.  
If you are not sure how to use doscp, refer to the section on DOS(C) in your 
SCO UNIX System V/386 Operating System User's Reference manual.

Remember that the configuration information on your Micro Channel machine 
must be updated before it will allow you to run SCO UNIX System V/386 with 
the Tecmar/Wangtek Micro Channel Single Chip Qic-02 Host Adaptor installed.
The setup/configuration routine varies slightly on different Micro Channel 
machines, but they all have a way to copy configuration files from option 
diskettes so that added cards may be recognized by the machine's setup 
program.  Refer to your machine's hardware manual to determine how it is 
done.  This operation is necessary for DOS as well as SCO UNIX System V/386.

The Tecmar option diskette is called a Tecmar Quality Tape Operating Software
Diskette.

The Wangtek option diskette is called a SYTOS Tape Operating System Software
Diskette.

Once you have configured your machine so that it is aware of the tape adaptor
card, you can proceed with the installation of SLS unx212.  Be aware that you
need to configure your tape adaptor card so that it is using a free interrupt
vector.  Below is a list of typically used interrupts:


Interrupt         Used For
---------         --------
    0             Clock
    1             Console
    2 (25)        Network Cards
    3             Serial COM2
    4             Serial COM1
    5             Parallel LP2
    6             Floppy Drive
    7             Parallel LP0 or LP1
 


SCO UNIX System V/386 Tape Driver Install
=========================================

To install SLS unx212, log in as root, insert the floppy into your floppy 
drive and type:

     /etc/xinstall

You will see the message:

     First Floppy? (y/n)

Answer "y" and then enter <Return>.

At the next menu, pick the option to:                                     

     Install a Tape Driver

A second menu will come up and you should pick the option to:

     Install Cartridge Tape Driver

A third menu will come up, asking you to display, modify, select previous,
or take default tape parameters.  Type "q" for quit and you will see the
message:

     Updating system configuration.
     Installing tape driver.

Picking "q" allows the tape driver to automatically use the tape controller's
parameters based on how they were defined when you updated your Micro Channel
machine's configuration information.
        
Choose "q" for quit at the final menu.  You will see the message:
        
     You must create a new kernel to effect the driver change you
     specified.  Do you wish to create a new kernel now?  (y/n)
        
Choose "y" and you will see the message:                  

     Re-linking the kernel...

This will take a moment and then you will be asked:

     Do you want this kernel to boot by default?

Answer "y" and you will see the message:

     Do you wish your kernel environment to be rebuilt now? (y/n)

Answer "y".  When you receive a root prompt, type:

     /etc/shutdown -g0 -y

to reboot your system and activate the new kernel with the tape driver
linked in.

Your original kernel has been renamed "unix.old."  If you ever need to
boot your original kernel, after a system crash for example, just type
"unix.old" at the "boot:" prompt.
