 Introduction

    The enclosed disks provide additional support for the following IBM
    Personal System/2 (PS/2) model numbers:

    8556, 9556, 8557, 9557, 9576, 9577, 8585, 9585, 8590, 9590, 8595, 9595.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  PS/2 models 8595 and 9595 using the IBM SCSI-2 Fast/Wide
       Adapter/A are not supported by this EFS.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    These PS/2 models use the Micro Channel Architecture (MCA).  Install SCO
    XENIX System V Release 2.3.4 for 386MC platforms using this supplement.

    SCO XENIX for 386GT platforms (AT or ISA bus) and SCO XENIX releases
    prior to 2.3.4 are not supported with this supplement.

    The supplement is required to support the following features of the
    systems above:

    +  2.88MB 3.5 inch floppy drive

    +  embedded SCSI controller on Models 56, 57, 76 and 77

    +  IBM 8mm 2.3GB SCSI tape drives

    +  level 2 cache auto disable (unless cache=on is added to the
       bootstring)

    +  Zimmer 486 memory controller to locate the precise origin of memory-
       induced NMIs

    The supplement also corrects known problems with:

    +  warm reboot

    +  mkdev hd command

    +  functionality of the parallel port driver

    With some versions of the Model 56 and 57 running XENIX there is a
    problem with the hard disk microcode.  Data corruption can occur in
    certain heavy load conditions. This problem can be overcome by installing
    the microcode update supplied with this supplement before installing
    XENIX. The microcode need only be installed once on any hard disk.

    The package consists of three disks:

    +  A microcode update disk to ensure the hard disk is compatible with
       XENIX.

    +  A replacement N1 (Boot) disk to be used in place of the one supplied
       with the operating system package.

    +  A LINK kit update disk to modify the appropriate drivers.

 Installation

    The installation consists of up to three stages as follows:

    1.  Updating the disk microcode if necessary using the microcode floppy.

    2.  Installing the operating system using the replacement N1 floppy.

    3.  Updating the LINK kit with the LINK kit floppy.

    These stages are described in detail below.

 Updating the hard file microcode

    Insert the microcode update disk in the floppy drive and boot the system
    with all the hard disks you intend to use with XENIX in the system. The
    update program will run automatically and detect any drive that needs new
    microcode. Only these drives will be changed: any others will be
    unaffected.

    Should a disk be changed or added to the system later, this update disk
    should be rebooted before the disks are used with XENIX.

    After running the microcode update the system should be powered down and
    restarted to activate any changes.

    You will not be prompted for any input during this process, though a num-
    ber of messages will be displayed.  The screen should appear similar to
    the following example.  The exact text in the lines describing the
    hardfiles detected will vary depending on the number of disks present in
    the system and the revision of microcode found on each one.

Installing the operating system

    Install the operating system on the machine as normal, using the
    replacement N1 (Boot) disk in place of the standard N1.  Make sure you
    install the LINK kit by installing all the product or by specifying that
    the LINK kit is one of the components to be installed.

    Boot the system and enter ``System Maintenance'' mode by entering the
    ``root'' password at the prompt.

 Installing the LINK kit update

    Install the LINK kit update disk using install(ADM) by typing the
    following:

    /etc/install?

    You will see the message:

       First Floppy? (y/n)

       Ensure the LINK kit update disk is in the drive.

    Answer ``y'' and enter Return.

    You will then see the messages:

       Extracting files

       Installing IBM Micro Channel EFS Release 2.0.0 for SCO XENIX 2.3.4 . . .

    If the LINK kit is not installed you will be given a chance to install it
    now. However, it should already be installed due to the previous steps.

    The LINK kit update is installed and you will see the message:

       Updating system configuration

    You will be prompted to enter your serial number and activation key to
    brand some of the components.

    You will be asked if you wish to relink the kernel.  It is recommended
    that you respond with ``y'' so that modifications to make the warm reboot
    command work properly can be made automatically to the relinked kernel.

    If the relink is successful, the new kernel will be installed ready to
    reboot.  The previous kernel is saved in /xenix.old.

    You will see a message informing you that the replaced files are saved in
    /usr/lib/ibmefs/save. The saved files can be deleted if the space is
    needed.

    You will see the message:

       Next Floppy? (y/n)

    Enter ``n'' and then Return.

    You will see the message:

       Installation complete.

    You will then be returned to the system prompt.

    Reboot your system to utilize the new kernel by entering reboot and then
    Return.

    If the LINK kit is ever reinstalled it will be necessary to reinstall the
    LINK kit update also.

 Additional information

    IBM 2.88MB floppy disk drive

    The file /etc/default/tar is modified during installation to add the
    numeric key 10 for the 2.88MB device rfd0135ds36. For example, the
    command tar tv10 could be used to list the names of files on a 2.88MB
    floppy disk.  This device uses a blocking factor of 18.

    IBM 8mm 2.3GB tape drive

    To avoid the situation where the 8mm tape cartridge is ejected after each
    use, a ``no unload'' device node may be created for use with this SCSI
    tape drive. The mknod command is used to add new device nodes.  To create
    a ``no unload'' device for your SCSI tape drive, use the major number of
    your normal tape device (/dev/rct0) and add 32 to the minor device num-
    ber. To determine the major and minor numbers of your normal tape device,
    do a long listing of the /dev/rct0 device node by issuing the following
    command:

       l /dev/rct0

    You should see something similar to the following:

       crw-rw-rw-  2 root  lp  10,  0  Sep 26 21:51 /dev/rct0

    In this example the major number is 10 and the minor number is 0. To cre-
    ate the ``no unload'' counterpart to the above /dev/rct0 device node, log
    in as root and issue the following command:

       mknod /dev/nurct0 c 10 32

    This creates a device called /dev/nurct0 with a major number of 10 and a
    minor number of 32.  You should use this device explicitly when you
    access your tape drive.  Or you can link /dev/rct0 to /dev/nurct0.  To
    link the two devices, type the following:

       rm /dev/rct0
       ln /dev/nurct0 /dev/rct0

    With the two devices linked, access to either device will no longer
    result in the tape being ejected after each use.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  You do not need to use a ``no unload'' device if you are
       already using a ``no rewind'' device - this device does not auto-
       matically unload the tape.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  The command tape -s erase will take typically two hours to
       complete on this type of tape drive.  This is because the tape is
       erased by writing data to the entire contents of the tape.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    Saved files

    The files on the original distribution which have been replaced are saved
    in /usr/lib/ibmefs/save. The saved files can be deleted if the space is
    needed.

    If you have any questions, please contact your SCO support provider.
