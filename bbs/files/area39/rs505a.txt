 Highlights of this supplement

    The following list highlights some of the more prominent changes this
    supplement makes to an SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.5 system.  For more
    details on any item, see the fixlist file referred to at the beginning of
    this cover letter.

    +  Inoperative buttons in the Backup Manager now work.

    +  The DFX driver now works correctly on a Corollary MP system.

    +  The paging daemon vhand no longer consumes excessive resources.

    +  The idrc.d scripts are now executed when expected.

    +  A hang during boot after installing SCO SMP(r) is eliminated.

    +  Performance is improved in Intel Pro100B drivers (versions later than
       1.1.3).

    +  The system no longer panics when an attached Chase IOLAN
       communications server is switched off.

    +  MaxSpeed external console stations no longer lose their configuration.

    +  Shared interrupts are now handled correctly on machines with SCO
       SMP(r), eliminating problems that caused some programs to consume
       excessive CPU time, generate excessive interrupts, and hang.

    +  Various legacy applications now work correctly under SCO OpenServer
       Release 5.0.5 286 emulation.

    +  Various programs have improvements related to the millennium change.
       See this cover letter's section entitled ``Year 2000 date-processing
       fixes''.

    +  The entire pkgadd subsystem is updated.  See this cover letter's
       section entitled ``New pkgadd subsystem''.

    +  The -v option to uname(C) now displays the operating system version.
       See this cover letter's section entitled ``New uname -v behavior''.

    If you have questions regarding this supplement, or the product on which
    it is installed, please contact your software supplier.


 Who should install the supplement?

    Install this supplement on all SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.5 systems,
    including systems with these supplements installed:

    +  oss459b

    +  oss491a

    RS505A includes and supersedes the above supplements.  You do not need to
    remove these supplements before installing RS505A.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  RS505A backs out a fix (bug ID SCO-247-112) that oss491a made
       to the pseudo tty driver (spt).  This fix prevented the select()
       call on the pty master from always returning ``yes'' after the
       slave is closed, which caused some programs to hang.  It was
       discovered that this fix caused other programs, including the
       Network Configuration Manager, to hang.
    _________________________________________________________________________



 Installing the supplement

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  If you are installing both RS505A and SCO SMP, install SCO
       SMP first. If you install SCO SMP at a later time, you must remove
       RS505A first.  See this cover letter's section entitled ``SCO SMP
       and RS505A''.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    You can install RS505A from distribution media (such as a CD-ROM or a
    floppy disk) or from media images on a software server or web site.

    The supplement consists of four files with names of the form VOL.nnn.nnn.
    If you download the supplement as media images, make sure you have all
    four files.

    To install the supplement:

    1.  Log in as root.

    2.  Start the Software Manager by double-clicking on its icon on the
        desktop, or by entering the following at the command-line prompt:

           scoadmin software


    3.  From the Software menu, select Install New.

       _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  You no longer need to select the Load and Apply menu
           options to install a supplement (which is a software patch), as
           you did in SCO OpenServer Releases 5.0.0 and 5.0.2.  Now you
           install a supplement using the same procedure you use to
           install any software product.
       _________________________________________________________________________


    4.  When prompted for the host (machine), select the current host and
        then Continue.

    5.  In the Select Media window:

        a.  If you are loading this release supplement from a media image,
            click on Media Device and select Media Images, then Continue.
            (You may need to pull down the scroll bar before you see the
            Media Images option.)

            In the Enter Image Directory window, enter the absolute pathname
            for the directory in which the media images reside; for example:

               /tmp

            Click on OK.

        b.  If you are loading this release supplement from a CD-ROM or
            floppy disk, select the appropriate drive and then Continue.

    6.  The Install Selection window lists the two supplements included in
        RS505A.

           You must install the Software Manager Supplement first.

        Select only the ``Software Manager Supplement'', then click on
        Install.

        There is a short delay while the installation takes place, and a
        message instructs you to restart the Software Manager before
        installing the rest of RS505A.

    7.  In the Installation Complete window, click on OK.  The Software
        Manager should now list the Software Manager Supplement.

    8.  Exit the Software Manager by selecting Host, then Exit.  Then restart
        the Software Manager, now patched by the supplement you just
        installed.

    9.  From the Software menu, select Install New.

    10. When prompted for the host (machine), select the current host and
        then Continue.

    11. In the Select Media window:

        a.  If you are loading this release supplement from a media image,
            click on Media Device and select Media Images, then Continue.
            (You may need to pull down the scroll bar before you see the
            Media Images option.)

            In the Enter Image Directory window, enter the absolute pathname
            for the directory in which the media images reside; for example:

               /tmp

            Click on OK.

        b.  If you are loading this release supplement from a CD-ROM or
            floppy disk, select the appropriate drive and then Continue.

    12. In the Install Selection window, select the remaining supplement.
        Click on Install.

        There is a short delay while the installation takes place.

    13. In the Installation Complete window, click on OK.  The Software
        Manager should list the supplements you selected.  The patched
        software is now installed.

    14. Exit the Software Manager by selecting Host, then Exit.

    15. Reboot the machine.  The Software Manager automatically relinks the
        kernel after each installation.  You must reboot before the new
        kernel takes effect.


 Installing the supplement across the network

    You can install the supplement from one SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.5
    machine onto another across a TCP/IP network.  To do so, you need a
    software server, which you can create as described in Chapter  21,
    ``Installing and managing software over the network'' in the Networking
    Guide.  This server has a user account called swadmin.

    Use the Software Manager to install or load RS505A on the software
    server.  (See this cover letter's section entitled ``Installing the
    supplement''.)

    To install the supplement onto a local machine from the software server,
    start the Software Manager and select Install New.  In the Begin
    Installation window, you are prompted for the source location of the
    patch.  Select From Another Host.  You will need to provide the name of
    the software server, as well as the password of the swadmin user on the
    software server.



 Removing the supplement

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  You must remove software patches (such as release
       supplements) in the reverse order of their installation.  In other
       words, if you installed ``Patch1'', then ``Patch2'', then
       ``Patch3'', you must remove ``Patch3'', then ``Patch2'', before you
       can remove ``Patch1''.
    _________________________________________________________________________


    To remove a supplement:

    1.  Log in as root.

    2.  Start the Software Manager by double-clicking its icon on the
        desktop, or by entering the following at the command-line prompt:

           scoadmin software


    3.  Select the title of the supplement you are removing.

    4.  From the Software menu, select Remove Software.  In the confirmation
        window, verify that you selected the right supplement, then click on
        Remove.

       _________________________________________________________________________
           CAUTION  Removing a supplement (patch) in the current SCO
           OpenServer release corresponds to rolling it back and unloading
           it in earlier SCO OpenServer releases.  If you need to keep a
           copy of a patch loaded, click on More Options in the Confirm
           Selected Software window. Then, specify Leave Loaded, and click
           on Remove.
       _________________________________________________________________________

        There is a short delay, then the Removal complete window appears.
        Click on OK.  The Software Manager should no longer list the
        supplement you removed.

       _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  Some effects of certain supplements are irreversible
           because of the nature of the correction (for example, restoring
           correct permissions on system directories).  However, removing
           the supplement will remove the patch name from the system.
       _________________________________________________________________________


    5.  When you have finished removing and installing software, exit the
        Software Manager by selecting Host, then Exit.

    6.  Reboot the machine.  The Software Manager automatically relinks the
        kernel after software is removed.  You must reboot before the new
        kernel takes effect.


 SCO SMP and RS505A

    If you are installing both RS505A and SCO SMP, install SCO SMP first.  If
    you install SCO SMP at a later time, remove RS505A first, then reinstall
    RS505A after installing SCO SMP.

    When you remove RS505A:

         In the Confirm Selected Software window, click on More options, then
         select Leave Loaded.

    To reinstall RS505A:

         In the Select Media window, select Loaded Software as the media
         device.  Then select RS505A for installation.

    See this cover letter's sections entitled ``Removing the supplement'' and
    ``Installing the supplement''.


 Preserving customized files

    RS505A backs up the following user-configurable files, then modifies or
    replaces them:

       /etc/conf/pack.d/str/space.c
       /etc/conf/pack.d/tcp/space.c
       /etc/default/device.tab
       /etc/rc2
       /etc/rc2.d/P86scologin
       /etc/syslog.conf
       /usr/adm/install/admin/default
       /usr/lib/hw/pci.cfg

    If you have customized any of these files, you can restore your changes
    from the backed-up copies after you install the supplement.  The files
    are backed up to:

       /usr/lib/custom/rs505a.sav/etc/conf/pack.d/str/space.c
       /usr/lib/custom/rs505a.sav/etc/conf/pack.d/tcp/space.c
       /usr/lib/custom/rs505a.sav/etc/default/device.tab
       /usr/lib/custom/rs505a.sav/etc/rc2
       /usr/lib/custom/rs505a.sav/etc/rc2.d/P86scologin
       /usr/lib/custom/rs505a.sav/etc/syslog.conf
       /usr/lib/custom/rs505a.sav/usr/adm/install/admin/default
       /usr/lib/custom/rs505a.sav/usr/lib/hw/pci.cfg



 Year 2000 date-processing fixes

    The following modifications have been made to system utilities and ioctls
    that affect date display or date processing:

    sddate(C), rtc(HW), getdate(S), sysi86(S), strptime(S)
         Year values in the range 69-99 refer to years in the twentieth
         century (1969 to 1999 inclusive); values in the range 00-68 refer to
         years in the twenty-first century (2000 to 2068 inclusive).

    getclk(M), setclock(ADM)
         A new flag, -t, calls date(C) with the -t flag (which includes the
         century).

    passwd(C)
         Output of the -s option displays the four-digit year.

    asktime(ADM)
         Now accepts dates in the following format:

            [[CC]YYMMDD]hhmm[.ss]

         CC is the (optional) century.

    pkginfo(F)
         PSTAMP now displays four-digit years.

    get(CP), prs(CP)
         The -ccutoff option now uses the same algorithm described for
         sddate(C) above.

    SCO offers a Year 2000 Date Processing Limited Warranty for designated
    software that adheres to the year 2000 date processing requirements
    listed in the warranty and meets other criteria also stated in the
    warranty.  For information on Year 2000 and SCO, see:

       http://www.sco.com/year2000



 New pkgadd subsystem

    The pkgadd subsystem has been replaced with an updated version based on
    the pkgadd in UnixWare(r) 7.  The changes consist of additions to the
    previous pkgadd functionality, so commands you are currently using in
    scripts and programs will continue to behave as expected.

    The related manual pages will be updated as soon as possible.  Until
    then, for information or instructions on using the new features of the
    pkgadd subsystem, please see the UnixWare 7 manual pages, at:

       http://uw7doc.sco.com/man/html.1

       http://uw7doc.sco.com/man/html.1M

       http://uw7doc.sco.com/man/html.4


    The following manual pages are relevant:

       displaypkg(1M)      pkginfo(1)
       installpkg(1M)      pkgmk(1)
       pkgadd(1M)          pkgparam(1)
       pkgask(1M)          pkgproto(1)
       pkgchk(1M)          pkgtrans(1)
       pkgrm(1M)           depend(4)
       removepkg(1M)       pkginfo(4)
                           pkgmap(4)



 New uname -v behavior

    In SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.5, the uname(C) command was changed so that
    uname -v now displays the version number of the SCO(r) operating system
    (for example, 5.0.5), rather than the AT&T sub-version number, 2.  (This
    change was left out of the latest SCO OpenServer documentation.)

    Once you install RS505A, you can recover the old behavior of the -v
    option by setting the environment variable UNAME_OLD.

    Setting UNAME_OLD also causes uname to display the machine's node name
    instead of the operating system name when you use the -a or -s option to
    uname, or execute uname with no options.

    To set UNAME_OLD, include it in the environment in which you are running
    uname; for example:

       UNAME_OLD=yes uname -v

    Alternatively, set and export UNAME_OLD at the command line:

       set UNAME_OLD=yes; export UNAME_OLD

    If you set and export UNAME_OLD, you must explicitly unset it to remove
    its effect:

       unset UNAME_OLD
