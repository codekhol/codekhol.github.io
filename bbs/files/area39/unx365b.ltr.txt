Dear Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) UNX365B contains various feature    
enhancements and corrections to known problems for SCO UNIX System V/386
Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.0 and Version 4.1 (Version 4.0
with Maintenance Supplement Version 4.1).

SLS UNX365B is designed to install ONLY on the previously mentioned SCO 
operating systems.

See section III for a list of functional components.

SLS UNX365B consists of a new N1 diskette for Version 4.0 or 4.1 of SCO UNIX
System and a custom installable diskette to be installed after the operating 
system is loaded.

The new N1 diskette OBSOLETES your current N1.  Please replace your current 
N1 with the appropriate (SCO UNIX System) floppy diskette from SLS UNX365B.
 
Please NOTE: On Version 4.0 of SCO UNIX System, if you install or remove
             SCO Maintenance Supplement 4.1 on your system, you should
             reinstall SLS UNX365B on your system before rebooting the 
	     computer.

I.   INSTALLATION [for systems already running SCO UNIX System Version 4.0
                   or Version 4.1 (4.0 plus Maintenance Supplement)]

The following procedure outlines how to install SLS UNX365B on an existing
operating system using custom(ADM):

1.  If the system is running in multiuser mode, log in as root on the console.
    After warning the users that the system will be down for some time,
    enter the command:

	shutdown  -y -g0 

    The system will then execute a controlled shutdown operation which
    will display the following message when the shutdown process has
    completed:

	**   Safe to Power Off   **
         	   -or-
	** Press Any Key to Reboot **

2.  Reboot the system.

3.  When the system reboots, you will see the message:

	Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
	(or give root password for System Maintenance):

    Enter the root password and press <Enter>.
    Wait until the "#" prompt appears.

4.  Next, insert the custom volume diskette labeled "Combined Updates 1.0
    for SCO UNIX Custom Install Disk" in the floppy drive and enter the
    command:

	/etc/custom

    The custom menu will appear.

5.  To select the following, highlight each one with the cursor keys 
    and press <Enter>:

	Install -> A New Product -> Entire Product

   - Position the cursor so that "Install" is highlighted and 
     press <Enter>.

   - Make sure that the words "A New Product" are highlighted in the window 
     found in the lower right hand corner of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - Make sure the words "Entire Product" are highlighted in the "Choose an
     option" section of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - You will be prompted to "Insert distribution Volume 1 and press <Enter>".
     The diskette is already in the drive, therefore press <Enter>.

   - You will see the following messages:

       Installing custom data files
       Executing Product Prep Script
   
   - The message "Saving Files about to be replaced" will flash on the screen.
     You will be prompted to "Insert the requested Volume and press <Enter>".
     The diskette is already in the drive, therefore press <Enter>.

   - You will see the following message:

       Extracting Files

   - When asked if you wish to relink the kernel, reply "Y" in order to insure 
     that the modifications from SLS UNX365B are included in the kernel.

   - You will then be prompted to "Press any key to continue"; press <Enter>.

   - At the main custom menu, move the highlighted entry to "Quit" and press
     <Enter>.  Press <Enter> again on the highlighted "yes".  

   - Reboot the computer.

   - SLS UNX365B is now successfully installed.

II. BOOTING - OPERATING SYSTEM INSTALLATION

The replacement N1 diskette OBSOLETES your previous N1 diskette.  If you
have not already done so, please mark your previous N1 as obsolete and
use the appropriate N1 (SCO UNIX System) supplied with SLS UNX365B.

					2

For the operating system installation process, every time you are instructed
to place the N1 diskette into the floppy drive to boot your system, simply
place the Replacement N1 diskette in the drive instead.  Then proceed with
the normal installation of the operating system distribution.

Take the following steps to install the operating system using the SLS's
Replacement N1 Boot Disk:

1.  Place the Replacement N1 diskette in the floppy drive.

2.  Manually reset the system or turn the power on.

3.  The boot prompt will be displayed:

        Boot:

4.  Follow normal installation procedures as outlined in the Release and
    Installation Notes.  

5.  After installation is complete, when you get the "SAFE to POWER OFF"
    message, take the following steps:

    a. Make sure the Replacement N1 diskette is in the floppy drive.
    b. Press <Enter> to reboot the computer.
    c. When the BOOT: prompt appears, type the following:

         fd(64)unix  root=hd(40) swap=hd(41)

    d. After loading text and data you will see the following message:
    
  	 Type CONTROL-d  to proceed with normal startup,
	 (or give root password for system maintenance):

       Enter the root password and press <Enter>.
       
    e. Invoke custom(ADM) by typing "custom" at the command prompt; 
       press <Enter>.

       - Position the cursor so that "Install" is highlighted and 
         press <Enter>.

       - Make sure that the words "A New Product" are highlighted in the window
         found in the lower right hand corner of the screen; press <Enter>.

       - Make sure the words "Entire Product" are highlighted in the "Choose 
	 an option" section of the screen; press <Enter>.

       - You will be prompted to "Insert distribution Volume 1 and press
         <Enter>."
         Insert the diskette labeled "Combined Updates 01 Custom Install Disk"
         and press <Enter>.

       - You will see the following messages:

             Installing custom data files
             Executing Product Prep Script

         press <Enter>.

       - You will see the following message:

             Extracting Files
   
       - When asked if you wish to relink the kernel you should reply "Y"
	 in order to insure that the modifications for fast computers are 
	 included in the final kernel.

       - During the relink process, you will be asked if you want to boot off
         the new kernel and if you want to rebuild the kernel environment.
         Reply "Y" to both questions.
     
       - You will then be prompted to "Press any key to continue"; 
	 press <Enter>.

       - Exit custom and reboot your computer.

       - SLS UNX365B is now installed correctly.

III. Functional components of SLS UNX365B

   1. A new console driver has been provided which can be switched
      between ANSI compliant mode and SCO backwards compatible mode.

      The driver comes shipped in SCO compatible mode.

      When the console driver is in ANSI mode, sending an \E[)m to turn 
      on graphics mode causes the driver to revert back to the primary 
      font (7 bit characters only).  This causes lines, boxes, and other 
      figures that use high order characters, to be drawn incorrectly.

      The escape sequence \E[=5L turns on ANSI compliant behavior.

      The escape sequence \E[=4L turns off ANSI compliant behavior.

   2. A new /bin/sh is included to support enhancements in the
      custom utility.

   3. The Western Digital controller device driver has been
      modified to accommodate 50MHz and 66MHz computers.
 
   4. The SCSI adapter drivers for Adaptec 1540, Adaptec 1740,
      DPT, and Future Domain have been modified to accommodate
      50MHz and 66MHz computers.

   5. New high speed dialers are included to better accommodate
      modems operating at 9600 baud and above.

					4

   6. A new CD ROM driver is included to allow for variable media
      block size.

   7. /etc/crash has been modified to allow for proper inspection of
      core files from computers with more than 16MB of RAM.

   8. /usr/lib/uucp/ct has been modified to correct a problem which 
      occurred when ct attempted to read long lines in /etc/inittab.

   9. A memory leak in /usr/bin/awk has been found and corrected.

NOTE: Refer to the Release and Installation Notes for more 
      information on how to use custom(ADM).

If you have any further questions, please contact your supplier.

Yours sincerely
