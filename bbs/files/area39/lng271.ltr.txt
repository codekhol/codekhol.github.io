Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed /lib/ldr Support Level Supplement (SLS) lng271 corrects the
following problems: 

(1) Dealing with common segment types.
(2) BSS data symbols in libraries. 
(3) Allows linking of programs that have static functions declared.

SLS lng271 should be installed on any machine running the following 
releases of the SCO development system: 

       SCO XENIX 386 Development System Release 2.3.0 with SLS lng085;
       SCO XENIX 386 Development System Release 2.3.1;
       SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Development System;
       Open Desktop Development System Release 1.0.

SLS lng271 will replace the file /lib/ldr with an updated version of
the loader. 

To install SLS lng271, take the following steps:
      
   1. Insert the enclosed disk in the primary floppy drive and close 
      the floppy door.

   2. If you are running SCO XENIX System V Operating System, type 
      "/etc/install" to start the installation of SLS lng271.
     
      If you are running the SCO UNIX System V/386 Operating System,
      type "/etc/xinstall" to start the installation of SLS lng271.
   
   3. You will see:
             
                 First Floppy ? (y/n)

      Enter 'y'
      
  4.  You will see:

                Extracting files ......

  5.  You will see:
   
                Next Floppy ? (y/n)
   
      Enter 'n'

  6. You will then see the message "Installation Complete".

  7. You may now remove the SLS lng271 disk from the drive. SLS lng271 
     is now completely installed.
