Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) UOD391A contains a replacement
parallel driver for SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System 
Version 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2 and SCO Open Desktop Release 2.0 and 3.0.

All known timing problems that can be encountered when using parallel printers
on fast machines, such as 486/66's, have been addressed in SLS UOD391A.  This
SLS also addresses some known problems, such as hanging parallel ports and slow
parallel printing.

If you require further information on the enhancements contained in SLS
UOD391A, please see the README file in the /etc/conf/pack.d/pa directory.

Installation Instructions:
==========================

To install SLS UOD391A, take the following steps:

(1)  Bring your system into single user mode.  To do this, log in as root 
     on the console.  After warning users that the system will be down for
     some time, enter the following command:

           shutdown -y -g0

     The system will display a safe to power off message when the shutdown
     process has completed:

           **   Safe to Power Off  **
                      -or-
           ** Press Any Key to Reboot **
             
     Reboot the system.  When the system reboots, you will see the message:
     
           Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
           (or give root passwd for System Maintenance) 
           
      Enter the root password and press <Enter>.  
      Wait until the '#' prompt appears.

      You are now in single user (or System Maintenance) mode.

(2)  At the prompt '#', type "custom".
 
     The custom menu will appear.  Select the following:

            Install -> A New Product -> Entire Product

     Insert the requested volume and press <Enter>.

     You will then see:
     
            Installing.."Executing Product Prep Script"
      
     You will be prompted again to "Insert the requested Volume and enter";
     press <Enter>.

     The message "Executing PA Driver Enhancements Init Script" will then 
     appear.

     Next, you will see the message:
     
     "You must relink the kernel to allow the changes to take effect."
     
     Answer 'y' if you wish to relink the kernel.  

     You must answer 'y' when asked if you want to rebuild the environment.

     Reboot the system.  SLS UOD391A, the Parallel Driver Enhanced Supplement,
     is now installed.


 Removal Instructions:
 =====================

     To remove SLS UOD391A, follow the instructions outlined above in step 
     one (1).  Bring your system into single user mode.

     Enter custom following the instructions in step two (2) and select 
     "Remove".

     Then highlight and select "PA Driver Enhancements".

     You will next be asked to verify the removal.  To do so, press <Enter>.
       
     Your "PA Driver Enhancements" will then be removed and you will be asked 
     if you want to relink the kernel and rebuild the environment.  Answer 'y'
     to both questions.
     
     Reboot the system; your kernel will contain the original PA driver.
