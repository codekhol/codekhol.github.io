Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) lng261 contains a new /bin/make 
program which corrects errors encountered while compiling files that reside 
on NFS filesystems. 

The error that occurs most frequently when using the original /bin/make is:

	rfs_read: attempt to read from non-file

This error appears on the console of the NFS server.  Compilation may or 
may not succeed when this error occurs.  This error is encountered most
often when the NFS server is running a non-SCO operating system. 

SLS lng261 installs on all releases of the SCO UNIX System V/386 Development 
System up to and including SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Development 
System Version 2.0.  This also includes the Open Desktop Development System
Release 1.0.1.

To install SLS lng261, take the following steps:

	1. Reboot your system.  Enter System Maintenance Mode by typing
	   your root password at the prompt:

		Type <Ctrl>-d to proceed with normal startup,
		(or give root password for System Maintenance):

	2. Type:

		/etc/xinstall

	3. Type "y" at the prompt "First Floppy? (y/n)"
	
	4. Type "n" at the prompt "Next Floppy? (y/n)"

	5. Press <Ctrl>-d and enter Multi-User Mode in order
	   for the change to take affect.

at (800) 347-4381.  SCO Customer Service is available Monday through Friday,
