Dear SCO Customer,

Enclosed is Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx257, the SCO UNIX System 
V/386 Release 3.2 Security Enhancement.  Please read the entire letter 
before beginning the installation of this SLS to insure proper configuration 
of your particular system.


SLS unx257 can be installed on the following systems:

  SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 2.0.

  Open Desktop Release 1.0.0, provided that the Open Desktop Maintenance 
  Supplement UFE has been installed.

  SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System, provided that the SCO 
  Security Supplement (SLS unx223) has been installed.


NOTE: THE OPEN DESKTOP MAINTENANCE SUPPLEMENT, UFE, AND SLS unx223 CAN BE 
      ORDERED FROM THE SCO SUPPORT MEDIA DEPARTMENT.
      SLS UNX223 CAN ALSO BE DOWNLOADED ON SOSCO.

(I)  INSTALLATION 

The Link Kit must be installed before installing SLS unx257.  The installation 
will fail if the Link Kit is not installed or if a required SLS is not present.
If the installation fails, the installation script will remove all the files 
read from the diskette.  Install the missing item and install SLS unx257 again.

SLS unx257 must always be installed after SCO MPX.  If SLS unx257 is installed
before SCO MPX is installed, then SLS unx257 will need to be reinstalled. 

Before you install SLS unx257, identify any changes you have made to the File 
Control database (/etc/auth/system/files).  You need to remake these changes 
in the new version of the File Control database after SLS unx257 is installed.

NOTE: SLS unx257 can only be installed using xinstall(ADM) utility.  Do not 
      use custom(ADM) utility to install or reinstall SLS unx257.

Begin the installation of the SCO Security Supplement as follows:

1.  If the systems is up, log in as root and enter the command:

	shutdown -g0 

2.  When the system reboots, eventually you will see the message:

    	Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
    	(or give root password for system maintenance):

    Enter the root password and press <Return>. 
    Wait until the '#' prompt appears.

3.  Next, insert Volume 1 in the floppy drive and enter the command:

        xinstall

    You will see the following message:

    	For each volume in the distribution set, insert the 
    	floppy into the drive, enter 'y', and press <Return>.
    	Enter the letter 'n' after the last volume.

    	First Floppy? (y/n)

4.  Enter "y" and press <Return>

    You will see:

	Extracting files.....

    when the contents of the diskette is read and the kernel is relinked.  
    Enter "y" and press <Return> at the prompt:

    	Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n) 

    Enter "n" and press <Return> at the prompt: 

    	Do you want the kernel environment rebuild? (y/n)

    This SLS does not create any device nodes.

5.  The following messages are then displayed:

	Uncompressing files....
	Rebuilding manual page index....
	Copying files....
      * /etc/profile not replaced
      * /etc/cshrc not replaced
	Checking permissions....

    Messages marked with (*) indicate those files that are not overwritten 
    with the new versions.  You can find the new version as /etc/profile.hush 
    and /etc/cshrc.hush.  (Refer to Important Notes)

    The message "Checking permissions" is displayed while fixmog(ADM) is 
    run to set permissions to match the File Control database.  You may see 
    a number of permission changes.

6.  When you see:

	Next Floppy? (y/n) 

    enter "n" and press <Return>.  

    Now you need to edit the File Control database in order to modify any 
    changes you have identified earlier.

    If you make any changes, you should run fixmog(ADM) once again by
    entering "/tcb/bin/fixmog".

The installation is now complete.  Reboot the system to use the new kernel.


(II)  Features in SLS unx257

SLS unx257 includes the following features:

  Enhanced crash recovery, including modifications to tcbck(ADM).

  Command-line utilities, rmuser(ADM) and unretire(ADM), for removing, 
  retiring and unretiring users. 

  The utility, passwdupd(ADM), to create a user who was added to 
  /etc/passwd file manually. 

  A hushlogin feature in login(M) for suppressing copyright and other 
  messages during a login.

  A new authck(ADM) -y flag that silently corrects any errors in the 
  subsystem database.

  The utility, fixmog(ADM), to change the permissions of all files to match 
  their entries in the File Control database. 

  The utility, cps(ADM), for setting the permissions of individual files to 
  match their entries in the File Control database.

  A locking utility, ale(ADM), that enables administrators to write scripts 
  that update the Authentication database. 

  The utility, ttyupd(ADM), that updates the Terminal Control database to 
  match /etc/inittab. 

  The utility, asroot(ADM) that allows an authorized user to run a defined 
  set of commands as superuser without the root password. 

  New semantics of PASSLENGTH in /etc/default/passwd that represent the 
  absolute minimum password length to be enforced by passwd(C).

  Modifications to su(C) 

	- Instead of allowing a user to su to root only, users can su 
	  to any account if they have the account password.

	- The system can be configured to a C1 level of security so that 
	  su transitions also transfer the authorizations of the account.


  (III)  Other Improvements and Additions

  SLS unx257 also includes the following improvements and additions. 
  Note: Unless otherwise stated the problems described below are present 
  in all the software environments specified earlier.

  addxusers(ADM)

  	- Now handles a relative pathname for the name of the input file.

  	- Allows the passwords of newly added accounts to be changed if they 
  	  did not have aging information.

  authck(ADM)

	- Increased robustness to repair additional errors in the subsystem 
	  database files.

  lpadmin(ADM)

	- Creates /usr/spool/lp/admins/lp/printer/<printername> with the 
	  correct permissions of 770, owner=lp, group=lp (previous versions 
	  of lpadmin created these directories with various incorrect 
	  permissions).

	- Can now be used by a user with the lp authorization.  
	  (This problem is not present in SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 
	   Operating System Version 2.0.)

  lpfilter(ADM) & lpforms(ADM)

	- Can now be used by a user with the lp authorization.  
	  (This problem is not present in SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 
	   Operating System Version 2.0.)

  sulogin(ADM)

	- The LUID is now set under all circumstances.

	- The gid is set to root's group as specified in /etc/passwd.

  sysadmsh(ADM)

	- The useshell helper program used by sysadmsh now displays 
	  descriptive error messages.

  at(C)

	- No longer displays error messages when used from an su session.

  chmod(C)

	- Displays more accurate error messages.

	- Error checking done consistently across all combinations of 
	  command line arguments.

  crontab(C)

	- No longer displays error messages when used from an su session.

	- No longer core dumps when an account name for the -u flag is 
	  longer than 5 characters.

	- When the -u and -r flags are used to remove an account's crontab 
	  file, the cron jobs for that account are immediately stopped.  
	  (This problem is only present in SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 
	   Operating System Version 2.0.)

	- The File Control database is used to obtain the correct permissions 
	  of crontab files rather than using hardcoded values.

  login(C)

	- Does not produce the 'cannot access Terminal Control database' 
	  message when a large number of concurrent logins take place.

	- The override shell spawned in emergencies now has its LUID set.

	- All combinations of null passwords and PASSREQ work as documented.

	- Use of an invalid username is now audited as <bad>.

  passwd(C)

	- Lockfiles are no longer left behind when setting a dial-up password.

  su(C)

	- No longer makes two entries in the sulog file each time it is used.


  umask(C) preservation

	- auths(C), su(C), newgrp(C), and at(C) now use the current value 
	  of the user's umask rather than setting it to 077.


	   ***********  Important Notes  *************


(1)  Because the sysadmsh System->Security->Relax selection edits system 
     default files that are then changed by system administrators, there 
     was no accurate way for utilities, such as rmuser(ADM), to determine 
     if the system had been relaxed.  To indicate relaxed behavior, edit 
     the /etc/auth/system/default files and change the u_secclass field 
     from "c2" to "c1".  NOTE: If you have a trusted system, do NOT change 
     this.
  
(2)  login(M) and su(C) now start the shell with the supplemental group 
     list set.  The supplemental group ID list is used in addition to the 
     effective group ID (EGID) in determining file access permissions.  The
     EGID is still used in file creation. The maximum number of groups in 
     the supplemental groups list is defined by the tunable kernel parameter 
     NGROUPS_MAX.  It can be changed by running sysadmsh(ADM), selecting
     System->Configure->Kernel->Parameters and selecting option 3, 
     "Files, Inodes, and Filesystems".  The parameter is NGROUPS.
  
(3)  login(M) and su(C) set the supplemental group list to the login GID 
     (from /etc/passwd), followed by successive groups (read from /etc/group), 
     of which the user is a member (excluding the login group).  If a user is 
     listed as a member of a group more than once, the group ID will appear 
     more than once in the supplemental group list.  When the list is full or 
     the end of the group file is reached, the supplemental group list is set.
     
(4)  This behavior is functionally equivalent to BSD's, except BSD uses a 
     fixed, instead of configurable, size list.
  
(5)  In SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2, supplemental group lists may 
     only be set, they are not used in access decisions.
  
(6)  The su(C) feature, allowing a user to gain the authorizations of another 
     account, has been implemented as a temporary solution which involves 
     changing the LUID of the su process.  All audit records generated by that
     process have the LUID of the su'ed user, not the original user.  However, 
     the audit reduction program can produce an audit report with audit records 
     labeled with the correct LUID.  Because this implementation can reduce the 
     integrity of audit data, this su feature is only enabled if the system is 
     relaxed (see below).  The implementation of this feature will be changed 
     in a future release of the operating system.
  
(7)  Note that when su'ing from an account, that does not have the nopromain 
     subsystem authorization to an account that does, the shell started by su 
     will still be running in a promain.
  
(8)  The new asroot(ADM) utility will also run a command with root
     authorizations if the u_secclass field is set to "c1".  Note that asroot 
     asks for the password corresponding to the LUID, not the RUID.
  
(9)  In SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 2.0, the 
     file /tcb/lib/setfiles is a nonfunctional utility; this SLS replaces it 
     with a link to /bin/false.  This command has been superseded by the new 
     fixmog(ADM) utility.

(10) When using passwdupd(ADM) to add users to the system, always add lines at 
     the end of /etc/passwd.
  
(11) On-line copies of the new and replacement manual pages are added to your 
     system during installation.
  
(12) SLS unx257 contains new versions of /etc/profile and /etc/cshrc which 
     have been modified so that no messages are displayed during a hushlogin.  
     If the existing versions of these files have not been altered from the 
     original operating system versions, then the installation script over-
     writes the old versions with the new versions.  If changes have been 
     made, then the new versions are left in /etc/profile.hush and 
     /etc/cshrc.hush.  The /etc/profile and /etc/cshrc files are sometimes 
     edited by a product's (such as ODT-DATA and ODT-DOS) installation script.
     Then SLS unx257 will not overwrite these files and will put the new 
     version as /etc/profile.hush and /etc/cshrc.hush.  If the files are not 
     overwritten, then you may want to incorporate the hushlogin changes into 
     your own versions manually, after the installation is complete.
