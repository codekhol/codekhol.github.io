Dear SCO Customer:

Enclosed is Support Level Supplement (SLS) lng248 which contains a new
/etc/cpd daemon for SCO TCP/IP release 1.0.1, running on SCO XENIX. 
This new daemon checks for copy protection violations only on startup of
SCO TCP/IP as opposed to a periodic check which presents an unwanted
network load. 

Note that this same problem for SCO TCP/IP release 1.1.1 running
standalone under SCO UNIX 3.2 and under SCO Open Desktop release 1.0.0
is fixed by installing SLS lng227. 

Below are the instructions for installing this Supplement:

	1. Reboot your system and enter System Maintenance Mode by typing
	   your root password at the prompt:

		Type CONTROL-D to proceed with normal startup,
		(or give root password for system maintenance):

	2. Type:

		/etc/install

	3. Type "y" at the prompt "First Floppy? (y/n)"
	
	4. Type "n" at the prompt "Next Floppy? (y/n)"

	5. Type Control-D and enter Multi-User Mode 
	   for the change to take affect.


If you have any questions, please call our SCO Customer Services
Department at (800) 347-4381. SCO Customer Service is available
Monday through Friday, 6 A.M. to 5 P.M., Pacific Time.

We appreciate your business.
