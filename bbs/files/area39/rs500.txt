 About this book

    This document describes the SCO OpenServer(TM) Release 5 Release
    Supplement (version 5.0.0d). It is a supplement to the SCO OpenServer
    Release 5 documentation. It replaces the SCO OpenServer Installation
    Notes (provided as a cover letter) and contains information that adds to
    or replaces the information in the following books:

    +  Release Notes, especially the section ``Release Supplement''.

    +  SCO OpenServer Features and Limitations

    Chapter 1, ``Installation'' describes installation changes for this
    Release Supplement (version 5.0.0d), followed by Chapter 2,
    ``Licensing'', Chapter 3, ``Software features and limitations'', and
    Chapter 4, ``Documentation limitations''.




 Chapter 1
 Installation

    This chapter describes the installation of the SCO OpenServer Release 5
    Release Supplement and of the ATAPI Boot-Time Loadable Driver (BTLD),
    followed by ``Installation documentation limitations''.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  The Release Supplement no longer includes the ATAPI BTLD. It
       is included as a separate disk with the SCO OpenServer Release 5
       product.
    _________________________________________________________________________


 Installing SCO OpenServer from an EIDE CD-ROM

    To install SCO OpenServer from an EIDE CD-ROM drive that uses the ATA
    Packet Interface (ATAPI), you must use the ATAPI Boot-Time Loadable
    Driver (BTLD).  See ``Installing your system using the ATAPI (EIDE CD-
    ROM) BTLD'' in the Release Notes for details.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  The ATAPI BTLD only supports EIDE ATAPI CD-ROM drives.  No
       other proprietary IDE-based or other CD-ROM interfaces are
       supported.
    _________________________________________________________________________


 Release Supplement

    After you have installed your SCO OpenServer system according to the
    instructions in the SCO OpenServer Handbook, you must apply the SCO
    OpenServer Release Supplement.

    If you have obtained the Release Supplement separately from a full SCO
    OpenServer distribution, you must roll back any previous Release
    Supplement applied to your system before you apply this Release
    Supplement. See ``Removing software'' in the SCO OpenServer Handbook for
    instructions.

    To install the Release Supplement, you must have 14MB free in the root
    filesystem. The installation process checks that this space is available
    and warns you if it is not.

*****************************************************************************

NOTE:  If you have downloaded the Release Supplement from SCO via your
       favorite download protocol.  Please see the "README" or "info" file
       located in the "Supplements" directory for information on how to     
       install this Release Supplement from disk images.

*****************************************************************************

    To apply the Release Supplement:

    1.  Log in as root and invoke the Software Manager.  (See ``The Software
        Manager interface'' in the SCO OpenServer Handbook for instructions.)

    2.  Select Software -> Patch Management -> Apply Patch

    3.  Select the installation host system or device from which you wish to
        install the Release Supplement (patch).  Click on Continue.
        (Alternatively, press <Enter> to choose the default.)

    4.  When you are prompted to select your installation media, insert
        Release Supplement Disk 1 into your primary floppy disk drive, press
        <Enter>, and follow the instructions on the screen.

 Installing packages over the Release Supplement

    The Release Supplement contains modifications to the following packages:

    SCO OpenServer system:

           +  Base Operating System:

              -  UNIX Run Time System

              -  Software Manager

              -  Run Time System Administration, User Administration, userOSA
                 package

           +  System V Link Kit files

           +  Extended Utilities:

              -  Basic extended utility set

              -  The vi and ex editors

              -  Additional system administration tools

           +  International Support, Internationalization Admin Client

           +  Optional Utilities

              -  Micnet and local message programs

              -  UUCP utilities, uucp and cu communications utilities

           +  Symmetrical Multiprocessing Support (SMP license)

           +  System V System include files

           +  Online Documentation Framework

    LLI:   SCO Network Drivers, SMC 8216/8416 Adapter

    NFS:   Base Network File System (NFS(r))

    TCP:   TCP/IP Runtime utilities and drivers

    MERGE: SCO Merge(TM) BASE package

    You must roll back the appropriate patch before installing or re-
    installing any of the packages in the list above, then re-apply the patch
    after installing the package.

    The following error may occasionally be seen when installing additional
    products on top of this Release Supplement:

       Packages that are affected by a patch were selected

    These will occur if the UNIX Documentation package was not installed on
    the system when the Release Supplement was first applied.  To avoid this
    error, make sure that the UNIX Documentation package is installed before
    the Release Supplement is first applied to the system. If you cannot
    install the Documentation package before you apply the Release
    Supplement, then if the above errors occur, you must remove the Release
    Supplement before you install the new product and re-apply it afterwards.

 Network installation

    If you are performing a complete installation of SCO OpenServer Release
    5, you can install the software from an installation server. You must
    load the Release Supplement onto the installation server.

    To load the Release Supplement:

    1.  Log in as root and invoke the Software Manager.  (See ``The Software
        Manager interface'' in the SCO OpenServer Handbook for instructions.)

    2.  Select Software -> Patch Management -> Load Patch

    The rest of the procedure is the same as that for applying a patch,
    described in ``Release Supplement''.

    You can then install SCO OpenServer and the Release Supplement from the
    server as outlined in ``Installing from remote source machines'' in the
    Networking Guide.

    If you perform an initial system installation from a network installation
    server, you must execute this command on the client immediately following
    client installation:

       /usr/lib/patch/enablepatch

    If you added clients to a network installation server prior to installing
    the Release Supplement, you must run these commands as root before you
    install the Release Supplement:

       netisl server off
       netisl server on

    Installation of the Release Supplement on an installed SCO OpenServer
    system from a network installation server can be accomplished as outlined
    in ``Installing from remote source machines'' in the Networking Guide.


 Installation documentation limitations

    Note the following limitations to the installation documentation:

    +  The example in ``Overriding the root disk geometry stored in the
       BIOS'' in the SCO OpenServer Handbook is inaccurate. The unix keyword
       should occur after the biosgeom keyword, for example:

       Boot: biosgeom unix

       See ''Installation Limitations and Workarounds'' in  the Release Notes
       for further examples.
    +  The information in ''About the Preserve hard disk option'' in the SCO
       OpenServer Handbook is inaccurate.  When you use the preserve option
       to set up a hard disk, the EAFS root filesystem remains after the
       upgrade.

    +  A portion of the online services information in the SCO Services
       Handbook is incorrect. To obtain up-to-date information regarding SCO
       Services, either contact your local provider or access our online
       systems.  See  ''SCO online support'' in Chapter 1 of the SCO
       OpenServer Release 5 Release Notes for information on online access.




 Chapter 2
 Licensing

    This chapter contains additional notes about licensing SCO products. See
    Chapter 6, ``Licensing and registering SCO products'' in the SCO
    OpenServer Handbook for further information.

    You may license additional CPUs for SCO(r) SMP(r) License software on
    your SCO OpenServer system using your pre-Release 5 MPX Serial
    Number/Activation Key pair. To do so, enter this on the command line as
    root:

       brand -g serialno actkey

    (Do not use the License Manager to license the additional CPU using an
    old Serial Number/Activation Key pair.) After this command has completed
    successfully, the additional CPU license will be displayed correctly by
    the License Manager.

 Installing the licensed product

    When you run the Software Manager, select only the product that you are
    licensing in the list. This is the product that appears on your
    Certificate of license and Authenticity.  Do not select OpenServer
    Software as your license is not valid for that product.

 Rebooting after removing a license

    If the Release Supplement is not installed and you have removed a
    License, it may be necessary to use a special bootstring to successfully
    boot the system.  At the Boot: prompt, enter:

       defbootstr ksl.disable





 Chapter 3
 Software features and limitations

    This chapter describes changes to the SCO OpenServer software since the
    initial release, followed by removed software limitations.


 Additions and changes

    This release includes the following additions and changes to SCO
    OpenServer:

    +  There is support for upgrading old custom-style products in
       custom(ADM).

    +  A ListPatches option to the customquery(ADM) command lists the patches
       applied to a system. The other command options remain the same. The
       syntax is:

       customquery ListPatches [-e] [-a accessType] [-D dir] [componentID . . .]


    +  The ioctl(S) MT_WMFM writes multiple file markers to tape, as
       supported by the SCO OpenServer tape subsystems. The number of markers
       written is specified by the third ioctl argument.

    +  A relax option is available for mount(ADM).  This option applies the
       checks on ISO9660 CD-ROMs that were previously applied in the SCO Open
       Desktop Development System. This option may be used to mount CD-ROMs
       that are not completely conformant to ISO9660.  The syntax is:

       /etc/mount [-r] [-v] -o relax -f [HS|ISO9660],special|resource directory


    +  SCO OpenServer Release 5 now supports the ibmide bootstring for Value
       Point models 355x and 40sx (the models that required the IBM Extended
       Functionality Supplement 35 in previous releases).

    +  Mapping of /dev/mem has been extended. This allows the support of
       certain X-graphics drivers for the Advanced Hardware Supplement (AHS).


 Software limitations and workarounds

    The following limitations apply in addition to those noted in SCO
    OpenServer Features and Limitations:

    +  In certain circumstances, the HTFS(TM) filesystem driver spuriously
       marks unused inodes as allocated.  To free the affected inodes run
       fsck(ADM) with the -ofull option on your HTFS filesystems.  You must
       unmount the filesystem to do this.

    +  You cannot view manual pages using a Netscape browser in a
       Microsoft(r) Windows(TM) session.

    +  It is possible to run a maximum of 32 Merge sessions on any given
       system.

    +  Products will look partially installed in Software Manager.  This is
       because only one of MMDF or sendmail for mail is installed.  The
       product will run properly if is appears to be partially installed for
       this reason.


 Removed software limitations

    This section describes limitations that have been removed.

 Commands

    The following changes remove limitations to commands. These limitations
    were not noted in SCO OpenServer Features and Limitations:

    +  The following utilities, which may have experienced problems, now work
       correctly under NIS:

       -  acctcom(ADM)

       -  ale(ADM)

       -  authck(ADM)

       -  df(C)

       -  integrity(ADM)

       -  prwarn(C)

       -  reduce(ADM)

       -  sdd(ADM)

    +  A problem has been resolved that occasionally caused badtrk(ADM) to
       fail to detect some bad blocks on SCSI drives.

    +  The custom(ADM) command now preserves the modification times of files
       from the installation media.

    +  dig(ADMN) is now available.

    +  Support for ecc(ADM) is now available for CBUS-II.

    +  fsck(ADM) now recognizes IFNAM files (XENIX shared data and
       semaphores) on an HTFS filesystem.

       A problem has been resolved that occasionally caused fast fsck on an
       HTFS filesystem to hang when performing a full check.

    +  Authorized users of lp(C) can now create printers.

    +  Setting the interval time to less than 10 using the setitimer(S)
       system call results in the signal being generated every 10
       milliseconds. (The call previously resulted in the signal being
       generated incorrectly every 20 milliseconds.)

    +  The undelete(C) command with the -m option now examines all
       directories with the -r option.  This means that it finds all files
       modified within the specified dates, regardless of the modification
       date of the directory that contains them.

       The undelete command can now be used on a directory whose ownership
       has been changed using chown(C).

    +  The vi(C) editor now expands the wildcard characters correctly in
       filenames.

 Files and filesystems

    The following changes remove limitations to files and filesystems. These
    limitations were not noted in SCO OpenServer Features and Limitations:

    +  Using NFS(r) with a corrupted client cache no longer corrupts the
       filesystem.

    +  A problem has been resolved that caused an HTFS filesystem to display
       the message out of inodes prematurely.

    +  A problem has been resolved that occasionally caused file locking to
       fail incorrectly with an EDEADLK error or to succeed when a real
       deadlock is being introduced.

    +  A problem has been resolved where a process could deadlock its copied
       data between a memory mapped file and a non-memory file if both files
       resided on a DTFS system.

 The Graphical Environment

    The following changes remove limitations to the Graphical Environment.
    These limitations were not noted in SCO OpenServer Features and
    Limitations:

    +  A problem has been resolved that occasionally caused a panic on
       attempting to swap out a SCO Merge win process.

    +  A problem has been resolved that occasionally caused clients with
       graphics to hang when starting on a remote X server.

 Hardware support

    The following changes remove limitations to hardware support.  These
    limitations were not noted in SCO OpenServer Features and Limitations:

    +  The Sdsk(HW) device driver has been modified to avoid performance
       problems with some disks.

    +  A problem has been resolved that caused the ioctl MF_RFM incorrectly
       to function like a goto EOD call.

 Systems administration, configuration

    The following changes remove limitations to system administration and
    configuration.  These limitations were not noted in SCO OpenServer
    Features and Limitations:

    +  You can now add group names that include a ''-'' character.
    +  A problem with adding users and groups for auditing in the Audit
       Manager has been resolved.

    +  A problem has been resolved that caused pseudo-terminals (pttys)
       occasionally to hang on close due to an infinite loop in ttywait().

    +  There is no longer a limit of 256 pseudo-terminals for telnet(TC),
       rlogin(TC), and other applications. The configured number of pseudo-
       terminals can now be used.

       The limit still applies to xterm(XC) and scoterm(XC).

    +  A problem has been resolved that occasionally caused applications
       polling on TLI endpoints to hang.

    +  Kernel hooks have been added for Computer Associates Unicenter.

    +  Problems in the XENIX(r) 286 emulator have been corrected. It is now
       possible to execute a wider range of XENIX binaries.

 SMP licensing

    The following changes remove limitations to SMP licensing.  These
    limitations were not noted in SCO OpenServer Features and Limitations:

    +  A problem has been resolved that occasionally caused a panic with the
       message PANIC: k_trap - Kernel mode trap type 0x0000000E on SMP-
       licensed systems.

    +  A problem has been resolved that occasionally caused recurring out of
       stream events were encountered messages on SMP-licensed systems.

 Databases

    A problem has been resolved in the semaphore driver which caused the
    Informix(r) database engine to execute unevenly.

 Systems calls

    The following changes remove limitations to system calls.  These
    limitations were not noted in SCO OpenServer Features and Limitations:

    +  A problem with aio_write(S) calls has been resolved. This problem
       caused Informix to fail.

    +  The system call utime(S) now updates inodes correctly at all times on
       an HTFS filesystem.

 Kernel

    The following changes remove limitations to the kernel.  These
    limitations were not noted in SCO OpenServer Features and Limitations:

    +  Execution of binaries that contain sparse blocks now works correctly.

    +  A problem has been resolved that could cause the kernel to panic when
       writing core files.

    +  A problem has been resolved that occasionally caused the kernel to
       panic when an HTFS filesystem was under heavy load.




 Chapter 4
 Documentation limitations

    Following this list are known limitations in these areas of SCO
    OpenServer documentation:

    +  Manual pages

    +  Operating System User's Guide

    +  SCO OpenServer Handbook

    +  Networking Guide

    +  System Administration Guide

    +  Graphical Environment Guide


 Manual pages

    The following limitations apply to reference manual pages:

    cmp(C)
         The -l option returns the byte number and line number at which the
         first difference occurs.

         cmp may also be used to compare text files.

    crash (ADM)
         The argument stream to the size command should be streams.

         The size command also has an argument htinode that recognizes
         structures of the type htinode.

    csh(C)
         The metanotation a{b,c,d}e is shorthand for abe ace ade. Left to
         right order is preserved, with the results of matches being sorted
         separately at a low level to preserve this order.

    crontab(C)
         To submit a file to crontab, as described in ``Executing processes
         at regular intervals'' in the Operating System User's Guide, you
         must type the name of the file (for example, cronfile) after the
         command.

    dd(C)
         The -lseek option should be -iseek.

    divvy(ADM)
         The limitation on the size of filesystems in divvy(ADM) is
         inaccurate. The maximum filesystem size that you can create using
         divvy is 1 terabyte for DTFS(TM), 512GB for HTFS, and 2GB for other
         filesystems.

    dktab(F)
         The example of a concatenated virtual disk provides 1.92GB of usable
         storage, not 1.92MB as specified.

    dosformats(C)
         The alternative device path for formatting A: should be /dev/fd0.

    ftp(TC)
         The description of the file .netrc in ftp(TC) is accurate. The
         description in netrc(SFF) is less complete, and should be ignored.

    gethostbyname(SLIB)
         The prototype for gethostbyname is inaccurate.  You should not use
         it as the basis of your own scripts.

    hosts.equiv(SFF)
         In addition to the constraints given, the .rhosts file for root must
         have no read access for other users. It must have permissions 600
         for root otherwise root login will fail.

    inet(SLIB)
         The syntax section should specify that you need to link with
         libsocket.a. Use the following paragraph before the syntax specified
         in the manual page:

         cc ... - lsocket


    lmcrc(LMC)
         The example on the manual page is inaccurate. There should not be a
         colon at the end of the mount command.

    lp(C)
         You can print a raster file, provided both your client and the print
         server are either of the following:

         +  SCO OpenServer Release 5

         +  A BSD-type system, for example, SunOS(TM) or Solaris(r)
         To print from an SCO OpenServer Release 5 server, the server must
         have a printer defined that can accept raster-type input. This is
         done using the command:

         /usr/lib/lpadmin -pprinter -Traster

         If a printer on the server cannot handle raster types directly, a
         filter must be defined to convert files to a format that the printer
         can handle, for example, PostScript(TM). This can be done by the
         following:

         /usr/lib/lpfilter -fraster -
         Input types: raster
         Output types: simple
         Printer types: any
         Printers: any
         Filter type: fast
         Command: command to convert raster file

         To print the file, type the following from the client:

         lp -d printer -Traster raster_filename

         See lpd(ADMN) for details of raster file support.

    mdevice(F)
         The x setting no longer has any effect in the ``chars'' field. It is
         included for backward compatibility.

         The d setting indicates that a device can perform DMA transfers to
         any address in physical memory, or does not require DMA at all. If
         this characteristic is not set, the device needs cache  buffers
         below 16MB. Setting this for devices which do not use DMA may
         prevent unnecessary use of low buffers.

    mount(ADM)
         The manual page mount(ADM) is inaccurate. To mount a filesystem of
         the type LMCFS, the correct form to specify the remote resource is
         server/share.

    pcipop(ADM)
         The daemon for pcipop is called popper, not as specified.

    scohelpXC)
         The default value for the variable trackVisitedAnchors is ``False''.

    tclsh(TCL)
         The line that you should  include at the start of a script to invoke
         the script file directly from your shell is:

         #!/bin/tcl


    useradd(ADM)
         The home attribute to the extended options is now called pw_dir.

         The attribute administrativeLockApplied has the opposite effect to
         that specified. When it is set to 1, the account is locked. When it
         is set to 0, the lock is removed.

    useradd(ADM) and groupadd (ADM)
         Attributes containing spaces should be enclosed in single quotes.
         The single quote character is the simple single quote, not the
         opening left quote character shown.

    userls(ADM)
         The nextUID attribute should be nextUid.

    vdisk(HW)
         The manual page vdisk(HW) is inaccurate. The limit for the size of a
         virtual disk on an HTFS filesystem is 512GB, not 512MB as specified.


 Operating System User's Guide

    In the example in ''Checking the status of pending file transfers'' in
    ``Using the uucp command'' the output field machine2 names the system on
    which the job is to be run, not the site name of the recipient's
    computer.


 SCO OpenServer Handbook

    The information  in ``Additional licenses and products'' is inaccurate.
    The following additional licenses and products are available for purchase
    with SCO OpenServer systems:

    +  SCO User Licenses  (for 10, 25, 100, 1000, or 5000 users)   (license
       only)

    +  SCO SMP License (symmetrical multiprocessing)  (license only)

    +  SCO Virtual Disk Manager  (license and media)

    +  SCO Merge  (license, media and documentation)

    +  SCO(r) Wabi(TM)  (license, media and documentation)

    +  SCO OpenServer Development System  (license, media and documentation)

    +  SCO LAN Manager for UNIX  (license, media and documentation)

    +  SCO Distributed Services  (license, media and documentation)

    Where no media is mentioned, the product is already installed as part of
    SCO OpenServer. Purchasing the license permits you to use the installed
    product.

    The example of the trchan(C) command in ``Translating files between
    different codesets'' in the SCO OpenServer Handbook refers to a mapping
    file that may be invalid.  You can find valid mapping files in
    /usr/lib/mapchan/ISO8859-1.

    In ``Dialer binaries'' in the SCO OpenServer Handbook, Step 4 of
    ''Creating a new atdial dialer'' refers to /etc/default. This should be
    /usr/lib/uucp/default.


 Networking Guide

    The instructions in ``Setting up anonymous ftp'' in the Networking Guide
    are incomplete in the printed manual. See the online documentation for
    correct instructions.


 System Administration Guide


    Contents of /etc/motd
         The information in ``Changing the /etc/motd file'' is inaccurate.
         The file /etc/motd is initially empty.

    User equivalence for remote administration
         The documentation does not specify in every case that user
         equivalence must be set up on a remote machine before you can do
         remote administration of any kind on it. See ``Establishing backup
         user equivalence'' for instructions.


 Graphical Environment Guide

    The menu option specified in ``Saving a color picture to black and
    white'' should be SaveAsBW.

    The URL for RFC 1630 in Chapter 3, ``Writing HTML documents'' in Using
    Help is incorrect.  The URL for RFC 1630 is now:

       http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/URL/uri-spec.html
