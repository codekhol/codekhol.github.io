Dear SCO Customer, 

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) UOD374A provides a new 
High-Sierra filesystem driver that addresses the following issues:

(1) Allows execution of binary programs that lie on a mounted 
    High-Sierra filesystem CD-ROM.

(2) Provides an option to remove the trailing dot from High-Sierra
    filenames that do not contain a 3-letter extension.  To prevent 
    the trailing dot, use the option '-fHS,lower' to mount(ADM).


SLS UOD374A will only install on SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Version 
4.0, 4.1, 4.2, and SCO Open Desktop Release 2.0 and 3.0 systems. 

NOTE: If you intend to install SLS NET362B, then SLS UOD374A must be 
      installed after NET362B.  NET362B provides support for mounting 
      High-Sierra filesystems across SCO NFS Release 1.2.0.  An upcoming 
      SLS is scheduled to provide the functionality of NET362B for SCO NFS 
      Release 1.2.1 -- this upcoming SLS may be installed before or after 
      UOD374A.

SLS UOD374A is custom(ADM) installable and removable.

SLS UOD374A consists of a single floppy volume.
