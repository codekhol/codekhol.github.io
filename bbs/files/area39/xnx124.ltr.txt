Dear Customer:

The enclosed Support Level Supplement contains a new /bin/fsck which
solves problems experienced with fsck quitting silently under SCO XENIX
386 Operating System Releases 2.3.0, 2.3.1, or 2.3.3 for AT architecture
machines. It is engineered specifically for these releases of the Operating
System, and should not be installed on a system running a release other
than these.

To install the new /bin/fsck file:  

	1.  Log in as root (super-user).

	2.  Insert the xnx124 floppy.

	3.  Run the utility "install":  

		/etc/install 

	3.  Answer 'y' to the "First Floppy (y/n)" question.

	4.  Answer 'n' to the "Next Floppy (y/n)" question.

	5.  Remove the xnx124 floppy and store in a safe place. You
	    will need to reinstall this supplement if you ever reinstall
	    from the original media.

	Your previous /bin/fsck file has been replaced with a new one.
	The following commands bring the machine to single user mode and
	run fsck to clean the file system(s):

	6.  /etc/shutdown su

	7.  fsck

	See FSCK(ADM) for details and explanations of any messages generated
	by fsck.  Operation of the system should proceed normally at this point.

Yours sincerely


Technical Support Department
