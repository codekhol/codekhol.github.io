APRICOT UNIX SUPPORT UTILITIES DISK

Disk revision:  5.0.1
Notes revision: 7

Note:   This disk is supplied without warranty or support.  It is
        designed to be of assistance to Apricot's UNIX reseller base.
        Suggestions on useful utilities are most welcome.  Please note
        that a number of the programs are inapplicable to SCO Xenix
        based systems. The changes from 4.1 to 5.0 include later u386mon
	(valid until 31/12/93) and an improved suite of backup scripts.

The following selections are available as packages under custom

BACKUP  Apricot example backup script with configuration file

IPB     This provides on-line all Intermediate product bulletins
        issued in MS-DOS, Network, Unix and Hardware sections. Due
        to the document header it may be unsuitable to run this
        on some terminals. A search option has been added to this
        script.

KERMIT  This is the Xenix/Unix kermit binary only, full documentation
        is available from Lancaster University.  The size of the
        available documentation regretably precludes us from supplying
        it.

LABEL   This option consists of two binaries which allow labels to be
        printed to dot matrix printers with reels of 3.5" and 5.25"
        labels.  Printers will be automatically installed called
        label3 and label5. You will be prompted for the devices to
        use, please have these answers ready.

MAN	The disk now includes manual pages for a number of the 
	utilities.

MISC    Miscellaneous utilities and scripts.

MON     This option provides a system monitor for SCO UNIX systems.
        This release of the product (3.74) includes streams, winchester
        and users reporting (inactivity for 1-5 minutes for example),
        it is best used on a colour monitor.  The file link_unix is
        edited to provide a utility kupdate, kupdate can be used to
        add adb patches as well as keep the monitor up to date.
        In addition the two commands below have manual pages installed
        so the UNIX man command can be used with them.

PACK	Zip, gzip and zoo archiving/pacjing utilities.

RLP     This is a remote lineprinter command, documents are not
        spooled locally but passed across ethernet to the specified
        target printer. The user rlp is created locally, this user
        should also be created on the remote machine, possibly by
        using the same installation. Otherwise the user id should be
        72 for user rlp with a group lp and a home directory of
        /usr/spool/rlp.

        rlp <remote host> -d<printer name> -s <filename>

        will print <filename> on the remote printer with <filename>
        already residing on the remote machine.

        cat <filename> | rlp <remote host> -d<printer name> -s

        will result in the local <filename> being printed on the
        remote printer <printer name>.

SERNO	Gets the SCO serial number out of some binaries.

SFIND   This is a basic version of find which allows files greater
        than a specified size to be found. To find all files greater
        than 300000 bytes the command would be

        sfind / -gsize 300000 -print

SPORT   This is the original sleepport utility which allows a
        serial line to be kept permanently open.

        e.g sleepport <device> <speed>


Several of the utilities on this disk make use of a window/panel
mechanism.  It is essential that your terminal/console is running
ansi, vt100, vt220 or Wyse 60 for most of the options.

All files are placed in the directories below /usr/apricot (excluding
the files created for spooler devices and temporary files) so there is
no worry about where this disk inserts files.  It may be necessary to
amend your path to include /usr/apricot/bin although the file
/etc/default/login is edited by the installation procedure.

Please e-mail any suggestions to peterw@apricot.co.uk or
peterw@apricot.UUCP as appropriate. 

One final point a version of u386mon which supports 10 SCSI disks is 
available on request.

Good Luck

Peter White.
