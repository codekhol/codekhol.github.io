Dear Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) xnx170 corrects problems
with installing a second Adaptec SCSI host adaptor with SCO XENIX 386
Operating System Release 2.3.2 for computers based on Micro Channel
Architecture (MCA).  These problems caused mkdev hd to fail when trying
to access the first disk on the second adapter.

To install SLS xnx170, log in as "root" and type:

	/etc/install

The installation will update the Adaptec drivers and relink the kernel.
You will then need to run the following commands in order to install the
new XENIX kernel as the default:

	cd /usr/sys/conf
	./hdinstall

Once the installation is complete the system should be rebooted off the
new XENIX kernel.  To reboot your system, enter the command:

	/etc/shutdown

It should then be possible to install the disks on the second SCSI host
adapter.

To install a disk on a second SCSI host adapter, jumper the disk to
be SCSI id 0 on the second adapter.  Once the disk is installed, issue
the command:

	mkdev hd 0 1

In the above command, 0 refers to the SCSI id and 1 refers to the
second adapter.

Please note that there are a number of configuration issues to be aware
of when installing a second SCSI host adaptor. The first adapter must be
in a higher priority slot number than the second.  Also, only the first
card may have the BIOS enabled.  The second card must have a lower base
address than the first and should be configured to use interrupt vector
10 (the first adapter is configured for interrupt vector 15).  There are
6 addresses available for use with the 1640 SCSI host adapter:

	0x330	0x230	0x130	- with/without the BIOS enabled
	0x334	0x234	0x134	- with the BIOS disabled

Normally, 0x330 would be used for the first SCSI host adapter and 0x230
for the second SCSI host adapter.

If you have any questions, please contact your supplier.

Yours sincerely,


Technical Support Department
