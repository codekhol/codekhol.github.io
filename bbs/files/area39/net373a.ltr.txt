Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) NET373A contains a new SCO NFS
driver which provides support for mounting High-Sierra (CD-ROM) filesystems 
across SCO NFS. 

SLS NET373A is only applicable to systems running SCO NFS Release 1.2.1,
which includes SCO Open Server Enterprise System Release 3.0 and SCO Open 
Server Network System Release 3.0.  Do not install this SLS on any other 
releases of NFS.

During installation you may be prompted for the NFS, or SCO Open Server
System, serial number and activation key depending on your current system
configuration.  Please read through the installation instructions for 
further information.

In order to mount High-Sierra filesystems across SCO NFS, install SLS 
NET373A on the NFS Server (the machine to which the CD-ROM device is 
physically connected).  You do NOT need to install this SLS on any of 
the NFS Client machines.


(1)    This SLS requires that the High-Sierra filesystem is already
       configured in the UNIX kernel, otherwise it will fail to 
       relink the kernel during installation with:

                undefined               first referenced
                symbol                    in file

                hsinit                  /etc/conf/pack.d/nfs/Driver.o

        ld fatal: Symbol referencing errors. No output written to UNIX
        ERROR: Can not link-edit unix.

        You can configure the High-Sierra filesystem in the kernel
        by running:

                mkdev high-sierra    

        You will also need to configure the CD-ROM devices by running:

                mkdev cdrom


(2)     Be sure to mount the High-Sierra filesystem locally on the server 
        first, BEFORE advertising it over NFS with exportfs (NADM).
        Failure to do so will give the error:

                mount: access denied for <server_name>:/<mount_dir>

        You can correct this by running:

                # exportfs -av

        This will re-export the CD-ROM filesystem after it has been
        mounted locally first.
        This is not a problem when the filesystems are automatically
        mounted when entering multiuser mode, using /etc/default/filesys, 
	as they will be mounted before exportfs (NADM) is run anyway.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

To install SLS NET373A, take the following steps:

        1. If you have a previous release of this SLS installed, be
           sure to remove it first.

        2. Shutdown and reboot your system.  Enter System Maintenance
           mode by typing your root password at the prompt:

                Type <Ctrl>d to proceed with normal startup,
                (or give root password for System Maintenance)

        3. Type:

                /etc/custom

        4. The main custom menu will appear.  The "Install" option
           will be highlighted.  Press <Return> to select "Install."

        5. A list of installed products will appear.  The first item in
           the list, "A New Product," is highlighted.  Press <Return> to
           select "A New Product."

        6. Custom will now display the installation options.  By default,
           "Entire Product" is highlighted.  Press <Return> to select
           "Entire Product."

        7. Custom will prompt you to insert "Distribution Floppy Volume 1."
           Insert the enclosed floppy disk into the drive and press <Return> 
	   while "Continue" is highlighted.

        8. After extracting some information from the floppy disk, custom
           will display information indicating that it is saving some files.
	   Custom will now prompt you to insert "SCO NFS 1.2.1 CD-ROM SLS 
	   Floppy volume 1."  Press <Return> while "Continue" is highlighted.

        9. If you are using SCO Open Server System 3.0 skip this step -- 
	   SCO Open Server 3.0 systems will attempt to serialize 
	   automatically from previous data.
           This step is only applicable to SCO NFS 1.2.1 standalone systems.

           After extracting some files you will be asked to enter the 
           serial number and activation key.  Enter the appropriate 
           serial number and activation key based on the information 
           detailed on the screen.

       10. The next prompt will be:
        
                "Do you wish to relink the kernel now? (y/n/q)"

           Type "y" at this prompt.

       11. After linking the kernel, custom will prompt you:

                "Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n)"

           Type "y" at the prompt.

       12. Custom will then prompt you:

                 "Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)"

           Type "y" at the prompt.

       13. Custom will prompt you to "Press any key to continue."
           Press <Return>.  Custom will then display the message:

                "Checking file permissions..."

       14. After completing these steps, you will be returned to 
           the main custom menu.  You may quit out of custom at
           this time.
 
           Then type:

               /etc/reboot

           to reboot the system. 

       15. Bring the system up and enter multiuser mode for the 
           changes to take effect.



REMOVAL INSTRUCTIONS
====================           

To remove SLS NET373A, take the following steps:

        1. Shutdown and reboot your system.  Enter System Maintenance
           mode by typing your root password at the prompt:

           list, "ALL," is highlighted.  Press <Return> to select "ALL."

        6. Custom will then prompt you to verify the removal of this SLS 
	   with "Do you wish to continue?".  By default, the highlight 
	   will be on "Yes."  Press <Return> to select "Yes."

        7. After restoring the original files, the next prompt will be:
        
                "Do you wish to relink the kernel now? (y/n/q)"

           Type "y" at this prompt.

                /etc/reboot

           to reboot the system. 

       12. Bring the system up and enter multiuser mode for the 
           changes to take effect.
