Dear SCO Customer:

The following instructions describe how to install and use your
Archive tape system with the VP409 Microchannel Controller in an
SCO XENIX environment.

The default settings for the tape controller board for DMA channel,
interrupt channel and Base Address are:

                                                     XENIX
                                                  Controller 
   Board    Channel    Vector       Address          Type
==============================================================
 Archive       1         3           0300H            1


Because of the configuration requirements on a PS/2, you must follow
the instructions below before inserting the tape controller card:

1.  While in system maintenance mode, run the SCO XENIX installation
    program by typing "install" and <RETURN>.  The following prompt 
    will be displayed:
   
                    First Floppy (y/n)

    Insert the SCO XENIX Archive tape driver diskette and answer "y" 
    (yes) to the above prompt.

    When the install process is done, a "mkdev tape" command will
    automatically be issued.

2.  Choose "1. Select Archive Tape drive" from the first menu.  Next, 
    choose "4. Select default tape parameters".  This is the recommended
    procedure for anyone who wants to use the default parameters or are 
    unsure of which parameters to use. 

    NOTE:  If you wish to use nondefault parameters and you know what 
           these parameters are, you should choose "2. Modify current 
           tape parameters", enter the correct parameters and then 
           choose "3. Display current tape parameters" to confirm what
           you have entered.  
      
    Select "q" (for quit) to leave the submenu.  Select "q" again.
    Answer "y" to the question, "Do you wish to create a new kernel 
    now?" Answer "y" to the question, "Do you want this kernel to boot
    by default?"  You'll then be prompted for more floppy diskettes.
    Answer "n" to this prompt.



















3.  You now need to copy the file "/Archive/@57fe.adf" to a backup 
    copy of your IBM DOS Reference Diskette. To do this, put the 
    backup copy of the Reference Disk into drive a: and type:

              cd /Archive             <RETURN>
              doscp @57fe.adf a:      <RETURN> 

    If you do not have "doscp" installed, you may use the CUSTOM(C)
    utility to do so.  You can find more details about this utility in 
    the SCO XENIX System V Operating System User's Reference.

    Now use the "haltsys" command and power-down your machine.  Insert
    the Archive tape controller and make all necessary connections with 
    the tape drive.  Now boot-up on your backup copy of the Reference 
    Disk and choose to autoconfigure your system, or, if you have 
    specified nondefault parameters in "mkdev tape", you may enter 
    those values by choosing "3. Set configuration", then "2. Change 
    configuration", entering your values and saving your changes.  Now
    boot-up on SCO XENIX, making sure that your tape drive has power 
    and is turned on.  You should now see that the tape drive is 
    recognized during the boot-letter sequence.  Assuming there are no 
    conflicts in the DMA, Interrupt or Address with other installed 
    hardware, your tape system should now be fully functional.  Try the 
    commands in Step 4, below, to test your tape system:

4.  To confirm that there are no interrupt or base address conflicts 
    between your tape system and other devices in your computer system, 
    issue the following commands as a test:

              tape reset      <RETURN>
              tape rewind     <RETURN>
              tape status     <RETURN> 

    The tape should be rewound after the tape rewind command.  After the 
    tape status command, the following information should be displayed:

                   status:   beginning-of-tape
              soft errors:   0
                 underuns:   0

    If your system hangs instead of displaying the status, there are 
    probably conflicts in the interrupt channel or base address.  Such 
    conflicts must be resolved by modifying the parameters in "mkdev 
    tape" as described in Step 5, below:






















5.  Run "haltsys" and boot-up on your backup copy of the Reference
    Diskette.  Choose "3. Set configuration" from the Main Menu, and then 
    "1. View configuration" from the "Set configuration" menu.  Scroll 
    down the View Configuration screen until you see the entry beginning 
    with "Slot '#' - Archive Streaming Tape controller (ID=57FE)" in full 
    view.  Note the values assigned to the Port Adresses (only the first 
    of the two addresses shown is important), Interrupt Request Line and 
    Direct Memory Access channel.  You will need to go back into "mkdev 
    tape" so that the values in "mkdev tape" are brought into agreement 
    with the values you see here.  This is done as follows:

    Reboot SCO XENIX, go into single-user mode and type-in "mkdev tape",
    then press <RETURN>.  Choose "1. Install a cartridge tape device", and 
    then "2. Modify current tape parameters", and make these parameters
    identical to those shown in your "View configuration" screen, above.
      
    Once you have verified the tape parameters by choosing "1. Display
    current tape parameters", select "q" (for quit).  Then select "q" 
    again.  Answer "y" to the question, "Do you wish to create a new 
    kernel now?" Answer "y" to the question, "Do you want this kernel to 
    boot by default?"  When this is completed, reboot SCO XENIX.  You 
    should notice that the tape controller is recognized during the 
    boot-letter sequence.  Repeat the tests in Step 4, above, to confirm 
    that your tape system has been installed correctly.
