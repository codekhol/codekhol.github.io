Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) lng321 contains several new
drivers and utilities for SCO TCP/IP Release 1.1.3, SCO NFS Release 1.1.1 
or SCO Open Desktop Release 1.1.  This SLS requires that either SCO TCP/IP
Release 1.1.3 be installed or that the ODT-NET TCP/IP portion of SCO Open
Desktop Release 1.1 be installed prior to installing this SLS. 

Although not required for installation, the features supplied in SLS lng321
for SCO NFS are only available if SCO NFS Release 1.1.1 or the ODT-NET 
NFS portion of SCO Open Desktop Release 1.1 is installed prior to installing 
this SLS. 

The new drivers are as follows:

- /etc/conf/pack.d/nb/Driver.o:
- /etc/conf/pack.d/udp/space.c:

	These drivers allow the NetBios daemon, /etc/nbd, to
  	work properly when there are older versions of /etc/nbd
	on other machines running an earlier release of SCO TCP/IP. 
	The following error, normally seen at the startup of /etc/nbd, 
	is prevented by this new driver:
	

		nb: namesvc: ud error 115
		dest 00000000:00000000
		nb: namesvc:expected unit data_ind got type 18

- /etc/conf/pack.d/socket/Driver.o:

	This new driver allows multiple nameserver lines to be listed 
	in the file /etc/resolv.conf.  With the original driver,
	only the first nameserver line in the file /etc/resolv.conf 
	was used.

        This new driver allows the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
	clnt_broadcast() to work properly.  The original socket 
	driver had a problem which caused this function to fail 
	with the error "out of streams resources".

- /etc/conf/pack.d/vty/Driver.o:

	This driver fixes a problem in the original driver which
	caused the system to panic under certain circumstances
	when using the lprint(C) command across a telnet session.

- /etc/conf/pack.d/tcp/Driver.o:

	This driver prevents the following error from occurring on
	the console of systems with an extreme network load:

		so_receive:not M_PROTO, found 0

	
Along with these new drivers is a new /etc/rlogind binary which allows
user equivalency to function properly with eight character user names.
Additionally, SLS lng321 changes the allowable number of UDP and TCP
connections each to 256.

For users of SCO NFS Release 1.1.1, or the ODT-NET NFS portion of SCO Open
Desktop Release 1.1, this SLS provides a more robust /etc/portmap which is 
able to recover from network errors that caused the original /etc/portmap 
to fail. 


To install SLS lng321, take the following steps:

	1. Shutdown and reboot your system.  Enter System Maintenance 
	   mode by typing your root password at the prompt:

	   Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
	   (or give root password for system maintenance)

	2. Type:

		   /etc/custom

	3. The main custom "menu" will appear.  The "Install" option will
	   be highlighted.  Press <Return> to select the "Install" option.

	4. A list of installed products will appear.  The first item in 
	   the list, "A New Product", is highlighted.  Press <Return> 
	   to select "A New Product".

	5. Custom will now display your installation options.  By default,
	   "Entire Product" is highlighted.  Press <Return> to select
	   "Entire Product".

	6. Custom will prompt you to insert "Distribution Floppy 1".  Insert
	   the enclosed floppy disk into the drive and press <Return> while 
	   "Continue" is highlighted.

	7. After extracting some information from the floppy disk, custom
	   will display information indicating that it is saving some files.
	   Custom will once again prompt you to insert volume 1.  Press 
	   <Return> while "Continue" is highlighted.

	8. After extracting some files, custom will display messages
	   indicating that it is installing the new drivers and utilities.
	   Custom will then prompt you for a serial number and activation
	   key.  Enter the appropriate serial number and activation key 
	   based on the information displayed on the screen. 

	   If you are running SCO Open Desktop Release 1.1, you will only be
	   asked for one serial number and activation key pair.  If you are
	   running both SCO TCP/IP Release 1.1.3 and SCO NFS Release 1.1.1,
	   apart from SCO Open Desktop, you will be asked to enter the serial
	   number and activation key for both of these products in sequence.

	9. Custom will display information indicating that it is adjusting 
	   the NTCP and NUDP system parameters.  An error at this point 
	   indicates that the parameters to be changed have previously been 
	   changed and does not necessarily indicate a problem.  The next 
	   prompt will be:

		"Do you wish to relink the kernel now? (y/n)"

	   Type "y" at this prompt.
	
       10. After linking the kernel, custom will prompt you:

	   	"Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n)"

	   Type "y" at this prompt.

       11. Custom will then prompt you:

		"Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)"

	   Type "y" at this prompt. 
	   
       12. Custom will prompt you to "Press any key to continue".
	   Press <Return>.  Custom will then display the message:

		"Checking file permissions...".

       13. After completing these steps, you will be returned to the
	   main custom menu.  You may quit out of custom at this time. 
           Type:

		/etc/reboot

	   to reboot the system so that the changes take effect.

Should you install SCO NFS Release 1.1.1 or the ODT-NET NFS portion of SCO
Open Desktop Release 1.1 at a later time, execute the following commands
while in System Maintenance mode to install the new /etc/portmap binary
that is supplied with SLS lng321:

	1. copy -om /usr/lib/lng321/etc/portmap /etc/portmap
	2. /etc/serialize /etc/perms/nfsrt


If you ever need to remove or update SCO TCP/IP or SCO NFS, please remember
to use custom while in System Maintenance mode to remove this SLS first.

If you have any questions, please call our SCO Customer Services Department
at (800) 347-4381.  SCO Customer Service is available Monday through Friday,
6:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., Pacific Time.

We appreciate your business.
