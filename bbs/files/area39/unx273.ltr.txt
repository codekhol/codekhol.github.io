 Dear SCO Customer,
 
 Enclosed find Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx273.  This SLS resolves an 
 outstanding problem with the SCO UNIX System/V 386 Release 3.2 Operating
 System where heavy serial input would cause serial I/O degradation and
 system hang. It will install on machines running:
 
         SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System 
         SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 2.0 
         Open Desktop Release 1.0 
 
 SLS unx273 will install on computers based on Industry Standard Architecture 
 and on computers based on Micro Channel Architecture (MCA).  This SLS is not
 applicable to operating systems with SCO MPX installed.
 
 To install this SLS, please take the following steps:
 
 (1) Reboot your system and enter System Maintenance mode.
 
 (2) Insert the floppy into your primary floppy drive and close the door.
 
 (3) Type:
 
       /etc/xinstall

       Do you wish to create a new kernel now? (y/n)
 
     Enter 'y' and then <Return>.  You will then see the message:

       Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)
 
     Enter 'n' followed by <Return> and you will see the message:
 
       Device node or inittab changes associated with this new kernel have not
       been made. These changes should be made by running touch /etc/new_unix;
       /etc/conf/bin/mkenv.
 
       Next Floppy? (y/n)
 
     At this point, enter 'n' followed by <Return>.  
     
 (5) You must now reboot the system so that the changes made by SLS unx273
     can take effect.  To shut down your system, enter the command:
 
       shutdown -g0 -y
 
     SLS unx273 will take effect when your system is rebooted.  Note that if
     you re-install your LINK kit, you will need to re-install SLS unx273.
