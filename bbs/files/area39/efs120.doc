Dear Valued SCO Customer:

We are pleased to provide you with the SCO LLI Driver Disk EFS Version 3.0.0.

The SCO LLI Driver Disk EFS Version 3.0.0 runs on SCO UNIX System V/386 
Release 3.2 Version 4.0, SCO MPX 2.0, and SCO Open  Desktop  1.1 and later 
versions of each.  

It supports the following protocol stacks:  SCO TCP/IP 1.1.3, SCO GOSIP 1.0  
and Microsoft LAN Manager for UNIX Systems 1.1 and later versions of each.

This version of the product adds support for additional LAN cards, a list of 
which can be found in the Release Notes and Installation Instructions, which 
you should read before installing the product.

You may be aware that Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMC) has replaced the 
Western Digital Ethernet cards with their own interchangeable cards.  SCO LLI 
Driver Disk Version 3.0.0 provides support for both the older Western Digital 
8003 and 8013 cards as well as their SMC replacements.

We would like to draw your attention to three known problems with this version:

The 3Com 3C523 driver in the product sometimes causes spontaneous rebooting
under heavy load conditions in the following configuration: 486-based, 
33 MHz   hardware running SCO UNIX System V/Release 3.2.

The Racal Datacomm NI6510 card does not work with a remote "nbstatus" 
on Microsoft LAN Manager for UNIX Systems.  If a machine tries to "nbstatus" 
the machine with the NI6510, the "nbstatus" will fail, and all of the 
LAN Manager sessions using the NI6510 will drop.

The on-line man pages in this product are obsolete and are being updated.  
Please refer to the Release Notes for current information.  

Please also note that due to the older hardware architecture of the 3Com 3C501 
LAN card and its relatively small buffer size, you may find this card's 
performance below average.

We hope you find this product useful.

Sincerely,


Products Business Unit
The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc.

 Chapter 2
 Overview of the SCO LLI drivers package

    The SCO LLI Drivers Package  provides a common interface for SCO's net-
    working products.  This section presents basic information on networking,
    then discusses the SCO LLI Drivers Package  specifically.

    +  If the SCO LLI Drivers Package  is the first networking product you
       have used, begin with the section ``Basics of Networking.''  This sec-
       tion provides the background you need to understand subsequent sec-
       tions.

    +  If you are new to the International Organization for Standardization
       (ISO) architecture, which describes a seven-layer hierarchical model
       and the concept of protocol layers, read the section ``Network Proto-
       cols and OSI.''
    +  All readers should study the section ``The SCO LLI Drivers Package .''


 Basics of networking

    Networking means connecting your computers together so that they can
    share information.  Effective networking increases productivity by using
    computer resources more efficiently.  A network puts the combined power
    of your system's hardware and software at your fingertips.

    Although there are many different types of networks, they fall into two
    general categories: wide area networks (WANs) and local area networks
    (LANs).

    +  A WAN connects computers over long distances using phone lines and
       sometimes satellite connections.  Computers on a WAN can be several
       hundred feet apart or on the other side of the world from each other.
       Sometimes a computer must go through additional computers, routers, or
       gateways to reach the one it wants to talk to.

    +  A LAN connects computers that are in the same office or in adjacent
       buildings.  All the computers on a LAN are connected to a single
       cable, unless they use a gateway or bridge.  A computer on a LAN can
       talk directly to any other computer on that LAN.

    Most networks are a combination of wide and local area networks.


 Network protocols and OSI

    A network, in the physical sense, consists of cables or phone lines that
    connect computers and data communication cards.  However, a network is
    not useful unless it has programs on each computer that let people access
    the various computers on the network.

    Computers on a network communicate in agreed ways called protocols. Pro-
    tocols dictate which signals computers use across cables, how they tell
    one another that they have received information, and how they exchange
    information.

    Protocols are more accurately termed ``protocol suites'' or ``protocol
    families.''  This subtle shift in terminology reflects the fact that the
    communications functions are complex and are usually divided into
    independent layers (or ``levels'').  The protocol associated with each
    layer communicates only with the layers immediately above and below it,
    and assumes the support of underlying layers. Lower layers are closer to
    the hardware and higher layers are closer to the user.  The number of
    layers and tasks that each layer performs depends on who defines them.

    ISO has a seven-layer protocol called the Reference Model of Open Systems
    Interconnection (OSI).  OSI has become a generally accepted convention
    for referring to protocols.  This model divides the way computers commun-
    icate into seven layers and describes the protocol used at each layer.

    The following table illustrates the seven layers.

   |                 |  the correct destination.  The|
   |                 |  network layer uses addresses,|
   |                 |  which differ in format from  |
   |                 |  protocol to protocol, to     |

   |                 |  from one end of the cable to |
   |                 |  the other intact.  A data    |
   |                 |  communications card in the   |
   |                 |  computer usually controls the|
   |                 |  data link-layer protocol.    |
   |_________________|_______________________________|
   |  1  Physical    |  Defines the way information  |
   |                 |  travels on a cable.  For     |
   |                 |  example, the physical layer  |
   |                 |  defines the electrical       |
   |                 |  impulse for a binary 1, and  |
   |                 |  it defines the speed at which|
   |                 |  the electrical impulses      |
   |                 |  travel.  The most common     |
   |                 |  physical-layer protocol for  |
   |                 |  LANs is the IEEE 802.3 proto-|
   |                 |  col, of which Ethernet(TM) is|
   |                 |  a subset.  The term ``Ether- |
   |                 |  net network'' is sometimes   |
   |                 |  used to refer to a LAN.      |

 Using the SCO LLI drivers package

    The SCO LLI Drivers Package  provides a uniform interface at the data
    link level:

    +  The networking cards and their drivers conform to the SCO LLI Drivers
       Package , thus allowing a consistent way to configure them.

    +  The SCO LAN transport stacks are free from low-level card configura-
       tion.  These transport stacks, which consist of the transport layer
       and below, can include SCO TCP/IP, SCO OSI, and Microsoft NetBEUI.

    The upcoming sections in these release notes describe in detail the two
    procedures you must complete before you can use your network cards: in-
    stallation and configuration.

    +  The section ``Installing the SCO LLI drivers package'' describes how
       to install the appropriate driver for your card.

    +  The section ``Configuring the SCO LLI drivers package'' describes how
       to configure your card's driver.

    +  The appendixes provide presents sample configuration procedures for
       the mkdev and netconfig utilities.

       _________________________________________________________________________
          NOTE  You should use mkdev to make chains between the card, the
          LLI drivers and the SCO TCP/IP Runtime (for SCO UNIX System V)
          Version 1.1.3.  Use netconfig to create the chains between the
          LLI drivers and any transport stack other than SCO TCP/IP 1.1.3.
       _________________________________________________________________________


    Your networking situation might require more than one transport stack on
    a single networking card.  In that case, you can configure different
    transports over the same driver.  For example, you can configure Micro-
    soft NetBEUI and SCO TCP/IP over one Western Digital driver.

 Chapter 4
 Configuring the SCO LLI drivers package


    This section describes the information needed for configuring the net-
    working card drivers to the hardware setup of the cards. For sample mkdev
    and netconfig configuration procedures, see the appendixes.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  Please familiarize yourself with the other cards and drivers
       in your machine before installing new or additional drivers.
    _________________________________________________________________________


 Configuration overview

    Each machine can support from one to four of each networking card type,
    depending on the type.  Use mkdev or netconfig to configure a driver to
    match each card's hardware setup.

    Different cards require differing information. Consult the documentation
    for your card and the section for your card in the section entitled
    ``Configuration information for supported cards'' to determine what in-
    formation you need to configure your card. Depending on your card, the
    configuration procedure may require you to supply an acceptable interrupt
    vector, I/O base address, cable type, RAM base address, RAM size, DMA
    setting and slot number. The parameters you supply through mkdev or
    netconfig must match those acceptable to the card and other hardware
    installed on your system.


 Interrupt vectors

    Before you install a networking card and driver software, choose an
    interrupt vector (IRQ) setting for the card that does not conflict with
    the IRQ settings used by your hardware and your other networking cards.
    Consult the card's documentation to learn its acceptable IRQ settings.

    Also, consult your hardware documentation to learn which IRQ settings
    your machine, hard disk, and current add-on cards use.  The following
    table lists some typical hardware interrupt settings:

    Hardware                         Interrupt Vector (IRQ)
    _________________________________________________________________________
    ISA, EISA, or MCA machine
      clock interrupt                0
      console (keyboard) interrupt   1
      floppy controller interrupt    6
    Hard disk                        varies
    Serial ports
      com1                           4
      com2                           3
    Parallel ports
      lpt0, lpt1                     7
      lpt2                           5

    After you determine your hardware's IRQ settings, choose settings for
    each networking card that you plan to install, making sure that the set-
    tings you choose do not conflict with each other.  The documentation for
    each networking card should indicate whether you need to configure the
    card physically to use the chosen IRQ setting.

    The operating system reserves interrupt vectors 4, 3, and 7 for com1,
    com2, and lpt0.  If you choose an interrupt setting that is either a set-
    ting reserved for another use or is in use by another device, a conflict
    occurs.  The mkdev and netconfig utilities resolve such conflicts by
    prompting you to remove the restriction on the reserved setting.
    _________________________________________________________________________
       WARNING  If you assign both sio interrupt vectors 3 and 4 to other
       drivers, you remove the sio driver from the Link Kit.  On a system
       running SCO MPX(TM), you cannot link the kernel if the sio driver
       is removed.  To correct this problem, use mkdev or netconfig to
       remove one of the drivers that uses an sio interrupt vector and
       reassign that vector to the sio device.  Then reconfigure the
       driver you removed, using a different interrupt vector.

       For details on this problem and the work-around, see the section
       ``sio Interrupt Vectors under MPX'' in these release notes.
    _________________________________________________________________________

 I/O base address

    The I/O base address is a unique area of memory allocated to a specific
    network card (for example, 300 is the I/O base address for the e3A card)
    in the system for input/output data control. The I/O base address must
    match the hardware configuration on the card, and other devices must not
    use this I/O base address. If you enter an I/O that is already in use by
    another device, you will delete that device.

 Thick, thin or twisted pair cable

    When you configure certain cards (for example, the 3Com 503 driver), you
    need to specify whether the board connects to ``thick,'' ``thin'' or
    ``twisted pair'' Ethernet cable. Thick and thin are both coaxial cable.
    Thick cable is approximately 1/2'' in diameter, and thin is approximately
    1/4'' in diameter. Twisted pair resembles a slightly thicker phone cable.

    +  Thin cable provides a direct connection to the network without using a
       transceiver.

    +  Thick cable connects your 3Com 503 board to a transceiver, which in
       turn connects to the Ethernet cable.

    +  Twisted pair cable provides a direct connection to the network without
       using a transceiver.


 RAM buffer base address

    The shared RAM buffer base address is a unique area of memory allocated
    as shared memory for both the host machine and network card for
    read/write operations.  Other devices must not use this address.  If you
    assign a networking card a RAM base address that is used by another de-
    vice, you are prompted to select another address.

 RAM buffer size

    Some cards (for example, most Western Digital cards) require that you
    specify the RAM buffer size as well as the base address.  A RAM buffer is
    a part of Random Access Memory that is set aside for use by the network-
    ing card.  Consult the documentation that comes with your card to deter-
    mine which buffer sizes your card requires.

 ROM base address

    Some cards (for example, IBM Token Ring cards) require that you specify a
    ROM address. If you have more than one card requiring a ROM address, make
    sure you give them different addresses.

 DMA channel

    Some cards (for example, the HP-EISA-32) require that you specify the DMA
    channel you want the card to use. If you assign a networking card a DMA
    channel that is currently in use by another device, you are prompted to
    select another channel.

 Slot number

    Cards (for example,the HP-EISA-32) that are meant to be used on machines
    using the EISA (Enhanced Industry Standard Architecture) bus may be
    required to provide a slot number. This number refers to the slot in
    which the card is inserted.


 Configuration information for supported cards

    To configure your cards you need to assemble several kinds of informa-
    tion.  Different cards require different kinds of configuration informa-
    tion.  Before you start the configuration, you should:

    1.  Find the appropriate section below for your card.

    2.  Determine what information you need to configure your card.

    3.  Consult the documentation for your card.  Although some of the
        default settings are supplied below, much of the configuration infor-
        mation requested is system-, card-, and machine-specific. All the in-
        formation should be recorded on a configuration worksheet before you
        attempt to assemble your network.  The following sections include the
        default settings where appropriate. You should add other relevant in-
        formation for each card, such as the other machines or networks to
        which each is attached.

    4.  Write the information for your card, network and machine on a
        separate sheet of paper.

    5.  Attach the completed sheet to your machine.

 3Com 3c501

    Begin the installation of an 3Com 3c501 card by reading the section enti-
    tled ``Configuration overview'' in this chapter. To complete the instal-
    lation of the 3Com 3c501 card, you need the following additional informa-
    tion:

    Card name               SCO LLI 3.0.0 refers to the 3Com 3c501 as e3A.
                            The first e3A card installed on your system is
                            referred to as e3A0.  If you install more than
                            one e3A card on your system, the cards are num-
                            bered sequentially starting with 0. Thus, an
                            ``e3A0'' indicates the first card of that type
                            installed on the system. If you install a second
                            card of the same type, it would be  e3A1, the
                            third would be e3A2, and so forth.

                            Default settings for multiple card installations
                            are found in Table 4-1.

    Interrupt vector (IRQ) The default interrupt vector is 3. This setting
                            is used if you press Return at the prompt.
                            _________________________________________________________________________
                               CAUTION  If the vector you select for your
                               networking card is already in use by
                               another device, you are prompted to remove
                               it or choose another vector for your card.
                               If you remove the device, you must supply
                               it with a new vector before it can be used.
                            _________________________________________________________________________

    I/O base address        The default I/O base address is 300. If you want
                            to add additional cards or change the default
                            address of the original card, make sure that you
                            do not choose an I/O address used by another de-
                            vice.
                            _________________________________________________________________________
                               CAUTION  If you use a base address that is
                               already in use by another serial device,
                               that device is removed.  If you want to
                               continue to use that device, you must sup-
                               ply it with another base address.
                            _________________________________________________________________________

    Cable type              The e3A card does not require cable information.

    RAM address             The e3A card does not require that you specify a
                            RAM address.

    ROM address             The e3A card does not require that you specify a
                            ROM address.

    DMA channel             The e3A card does not require that  you specify a
                            DMA channel.

    Begin the installation of a 3Com 3c503 card by reading the section enti-
    tled ``Configuration overview'' in this chapter. To complete the instal-
    lation of the card, you need the following additional information:

    Card name               SCO LLI 3.0.0 refers to the 3Com 3c503 as e3B.
                            The first e3B card installed on your system is
                            referred to as e3B0.  If you install more than
                            one e3B card on your system, the cards are num-
                            bered sequentially starting with 0. Thus, an
                            ``e3B0'' indicates the first card of that type

 3Com 3c507

    Begin the installation of an 3Com EtherLink 16 (3c507) card by reading
    the section entitled ``Configuration overview'' in this chapter. To com-
    plete the installation of the 3c507 card you must follow these steps;

    +  Use mkdev or netconfig to configure the driver.

    +  Use e3dsetup to configure the card.

    Although both mkdev or netconfig and e3dsetup require the same informa-
    tion, you should configure the driver first. Both mkdev and netconfig
    check the parameters you supply for conflicts with other devices.  If
    found, they prompt you to select another parameter. Once you have
    selected a configuration that does not conflict with other devices, those
    parameters can be supplied to the e3D card with e3dsetup.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       CAUTION  When you use e3dsetup to configure your card, note that
       the 3c507 cards can be set to use either 8 or 16 bit data
       transfers.  Acceptable values for this options are standard for 8-
       bit data transfer and turbo for 16-bit data transfer. The 3c507
       card does not work in 16-bit mode with some motherboard chip sets.
       If your 3c507 card does not work in 16 bit mode, try the 8-bit mode
    _________________________________________________________________________

    Both mkdev (or netconfig) and e3dsetup require the following additional
    information.

    Card name               SCO LLI 3.0.0 refers to the 3Com 3c507 as e3D.

                            is used if you press Return at the prompt. If
                            this interrupt is already in use, you are
                            prompted to select another.

                            _________________________________________________________________________
                               CAUTION  If the vector you select for your
                               networking card is already in use by
                               another device, you are prompted to remove
                               it or choose another vector for your card.
                               If you remove the device, you must supply
                               it with a new vector before it can be used.
                            _________________________________________________________________________


    I/O base address        The default I/O base address for the i6E is 360
                            If you want to change the default address of the
                            original card, make sure that you do not choose
                            an I/O address used by another device.

                            _________________________________________________________________________
                               CAUTION  If you use a base address that is
                               already in use by another serial device,
                               that device is removed.  If you want to
                               continue to use that device, you must sup-
                               ply it with another base address.
                            _________________________________________________________________________


    Cable type              The i6E card does not require cable information.

    RAM address             The i6E care does not require RAM address infor-
                            mation.

    ROM address             The i6E card does not require that you specify a
                            ROM address.

    DMA channel             The default DMA channel is 3.  If you change the
                            DMA channel or install another card, make sure
                            you select a channel not used by another device.

    Slot number             The i6E card does not require a slot number.


 IBM Token Ring driver

    Begin the installation of an IBM Token Ring card by reading the section
    entitled ``Configuration overview'' in this chapter. To complete the in-
    stallation of an IBM Token Ring card, you need the following additional
    information:

    Card name               SCO LLI 3.0.0 refers to the IBM Token Ring card
                            as tok.  The first tok card installed on your
                            system is referred to as tok0.  You can install
                            the Token Ring using either one or two adapter
                            cards.  If you install more than one Token Ring
                            on your system, the cards are numbered sequen-
                            tially starting with 0. Thus, ``tok0'' indicates
                            the first card of that type installed on the sys-
                            tem. If you install a second card of the same
                            type, it would be tok1.  If you are using two
                            cards, use the Primary-Alternate switches on the
                            cards to set up one as the primary adapter and
                            the other as the alternate adapter.  Obtain
                            switch information for these cards from the docu-
                            mentation supplied by the card manufacturer.

                            The size of the shared RAM on the Token Ring
                            adapter should be set to 16 K.

                            _________________________________________________________________________
                               NOTE  The Token Ring card configuration
                               copies the file:

                               /etc/conf/pack.d/sio/space.c
                               to
                               /etc/conf/pack.d/sio/space.c.rls

                               and removes the COM3 entry from space.c.
                               This corrects a problem that caused the
                               Token Ring card to appear as a serial card
                               with a different name at boot time.
                            _________________________________________________________________________

    Interrupt vector (IRQ)  The default interrupt vector is 2. This setting
                            is used if you press Return at the prompt.
                            _________________________________________________________________________
                               CAUTION  If the vector you select for your
                               networking card is already in use by
                               another device, you are prompted to remove
                               it or choose another vector for your card.
                               If you remove the device, you must supply
                               it with a new vector before it can be used.
                            _________________________________________________________________________
                            You should install your primary adapter card
                            using IRQ2, which is the factory default.  If you
                            are installing an alternate adapter, use IRQ3.
                            You can also use IRQ6 and IRQ7 to install Token
                            Ring adapter cards. If you want to use either of
                            these interrupt vectors to install a Token Ring
                            adapter, check your system configuration for IRQ
                            conflicts.

    I/O base address        The default I/O base address is 300. If this
                            address is in use, you must choose another. If
                            you attempt to use a base address that is already
                            in use by another serial device, that device is
                            removed.

                            _________________________________________________________________________
                               CAUTION  Because the tok adapter also uses
                               I/O address 0x2f0 for writing network in-
                               formation, no other device may use that
                               address.
                            _________________________________________________________________________


    Cable type              The Token Ring card installation does not require
                            cabling information.

    RAM address             The default RAM address for the IBM Token Ring
                            card is D8000.  If you want to add additional
                            cards or change that address, make sure that you
                            do not choose an address used by another device.

                            When you configure a driver on your SCO UNIX sys-
                            tem, the configuration utility checks to make
                            sure that the new driver's parameters are dif-
                            ferent from the parameters for drivers already on
                            the system.  Parameters for the Token Ring 16/4
                            and Token Ring PC II adapters include shared RAM
                            addresses and configurable ROM addresses.  The
                            RAM addresses are hard-coded for AT machines
                            (0xd8000-0xdbfff for the primary adapter and
                            0xd4000-0xd7fff for the secondary adapter).  You
                            set the ROM addresses (for all machines), as well
                            as the RAM addresses (for MC machines), when you
                            configure the adapter.

                            _________________________________________________________________________
                               CAUTION  During configuration, the system
                               checks both sets of addresses for conflicts
                               with currently installed drivers.  However,
                               the Link Kit can record only one set of
                               addresses for future checking.  Because the
                               RAM addresses are hard-coded, the Link Kit
                               records the variable ROM addresses.

                               This means that if you install another
                               driver with shared RAM addresses after you
                               install the Token Ring driver, the system
                               cannot detect possible conflicts with the
                               shared RAM addresses the Token-Ring adapter
                               uses.  Therefore, if you install another
                               driver that uses shared RAM addresses after
                               you install the Token Ring adapter, take
                               precautions not to introduce RAM address
                               conflicts.
                            _________________________________________________________________________

    ROM address             The default ROM address for the IBM Token Ring
                            card is CC000.  If you want to add additional
                            cards or change that address, make sure that you
                            do not choose an address used by another device.

    DMA channel             The IBM Token Ring card does not require that
                            you specify a DMA channel.

    Ring routing            Token Ring allows you to establish connections
                            from your machine to other machines in either of
                            the following ways:

                            +  on the local ring

                            +  on another ring using a bridge
                            When you use a bridge, the rings appear as a sin-
                            gle local area network (LAN).

                            If you are connecting two or more rings using
                            bridges, you must enable Token Ring routing.
                            Without Token Ring routing, you can only estab-
                            lish connections on the local ring from your ma-
                            chine.  (However, if a bridge exists on the local
                            ring, a non-local machine with routing can estab-
                            lish a connection with your machine.)  Token Ring
                            routing makes use of the Routing Information
                            field, which is part of the Token Ring frame.

                            During configuration you can enable or disable
                            this function when the following prompt is dis-
                            played:

    _________________________________________________________________________
    Restrict broadcasts to the local ring (y/n) [N] or 'q' to quit:
                  _________________________________________________________________________


                            To select Token Ring routing, enter n at this
                            prompt.  If you decide not to use Token Ring
                            routing (that is, if you decide to restrict
                            broadcasts to the local ring), enter y.

                            If you do not use Token Ring routing, the program
                            creates the file /usr/lib/token/noroute0. This
                            file suppresses Token Ring routing for the pri-
                            mary adapter.  The file /usr/lib/token/noroute1
                            suppresses Token Ring routing for the alternate
                            adapter.
                            If you want to connect two or more networks using
                            a gateway, you must install both primary and
                            alternate adapters on the gateway machine.


 Western Digital 8003 or 8013 (elite)

    Begin the installation of a Western Digital card by reading the section
    entitled ``Configuration overview'' in this chapter. To complete the in-
    stallation of a Western Digital card you must follow these steps;

    +  Use mkdev or netconfig to configure the driver.

    +  Use wdnsetup to configure the card.

    Although both mkdev or netconfig and wdnsetup require the same informa-
    tion, you should configure the driver first. Both mkdev and netconfig
    check the parameters you supply for conflicts with other devices.  If
    found, they prompt you to select another parameter. Once you have
    selected a configuration that does not conflict with other devices, those
    parameters can be supplied to the Wester Digital card with wdnsetup.
    Both mkdev (or netconfig) and wdnsetup require the following additional
    information.

    Card name               SCO LLI 3.0.0 refers to the Western Digital 8003
                            and the Western Digital 8013 (elite) card as wdn.
                            The installation requires that you know whether
                            your card is an 8003 or an 8013 (elite).  The
                            first wdn card installed on your system is
                            referred to as wdn0.  If you install more than
                            one wdn card on your system, the cards are num-
                            bered sequentially starting with 0. Thus, an
                            ``wdn0'' indicates the first card of that type
                            installed on the system. If you install a second
                            card of the same type, it would be  wdn1, the
                            third would be wdn2, and so forth.

                            Default settings for multiple card installations
                            are found in Table 4-1.

    Interrupt vector (IRQ)  The default interrupt vector is 3. This setting
                            is used if you press Return at the prompt.

                            _________________________________________________________________________
                               CAUTION  If the vector you select for your
                               networking card is already in use by
                               another device, you are prompted to remove
                               it or choose another vector for your card.
                               If you remove the device, you must supply
                               it with a new vector before it can be used.
                            _________________________________________________________________________


    I/O base address        The default I/O base address is 240.

                            _________________________________________________________________________
                               CAUTION  If this address is in use, you
                               must choose another. If you attempt to use
                               a base address that is already in use by
                               another serial device, it may be removed.

                               Do not use I/O base addresses 0x200, 0x220,
                               0x340, 0x3C0, or 0x3E0 for the Western
                               Digital 8003E and 8013EBT cards.  Because
                               of register-address aliasing, these
                               addresses can cause your machine to hang at
                               boot time.

                               Western Digital cards also require that you
                               specify the size of the RAM buffer. Consult
                               the card documentation to determine which
                               buffer sizes your card requires.
                            _________________________________________________________________________


    Cable type              To install the wdn card, no cable information is
                            required.

    RAM address             The default RAM address for the wdn card is
                            D0000. If you want to add additional cards or
                            change that address, make sure that you do not
                            choose an address used by another device.

    ROM address             The wdn card does not require that you specify a
                            ROM address.

    DMA channel             The wdn card does not require that  you specify a
                            DMA channel.

    Slot number             The wdn card does not require a slot number.

 Removing the SCO LLI drivers package

    _________________________________________________________________________
       CAUTION  If you need to remove the SCO LLI Drivers Package  from a
       system running SCO TCP/IP version 1.1.3, first remove the LLI
       Drivers, then remove TCP/IP, then reinstall TCP/IP.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    To remove the SCO LLI Drivers Package , follow the instructions below.

    1.  Reboot the machine.

    2.  Enter System Maintenance (single-user) mode by entering the root
        password.

    3.  At the prompt, enter:

           custom

        The main custom menu appears.

    4.  Use the -> to highlight the Remove option, then press Return.

        custom displays the Remove screen, with a list of currently installed
        software at the bottom right corner.

    5.  Use the v to highlight SCO LLI Driver disk, then press Return.

        The Remove screen appears with a list of currently installed SCO LLI
        Driver packages at the bottom.

    6.  Select the drivers you need to remove.

        Use ^ or v to highlight a package, and press Space to select it.  An
        asterisk ``*'' appears by the package.  Repeat the highlight and
        space procedure until all packages you want to remove are marked by
        an asterisk.  Then press Return.

        You are prompted to continue.

    7.  To continue, press Return.

        You see a message that the system is executing the removal script,
        and are prompted to continue.

    8.  Press any key to continue with the removal.
        You see the following message:

    _________________________________________________________________________
    Creating file list ...
        _________________________________________________________________________


        You return to the main custom menu.

        If you have removed the software using the All option, the software
        list on your screen no longer includes the SCO LLI Driver disk.

        You can continue removing other products or you can quit custom.

    9.  When you are ready to quit custom, use -> to highlight the Quit
        option.  Press Return.  custom asks you to confirm that you want to
        quit, and highlights the Yes option.  Press Return.






 Chapter 6
 Known limitations with this release

    This section describes the known limitations with this release of SCO LLI
    Drivers Package .


 Displaying statistics with LLI

    Recent improvements to the statistics-gathering method used by SCO LLI
    Drivers Package  result in an incompatibility between the OSI mac utility
    and the LLI drivers.  In place of mac, this SCO LLI Drivers Package
    includes the llistat(ADM) utility.  A manual page describing llistat
    appears at the end of these release notes.  (The mac utility is described
    in the section ``Display MAC Entity Management Statistics: mac,'' in the
    SCO/Retix OSI/LT-610 Administrator Guide.)

    A future release of SCO OSI will eliminate the current mac incompatibili-
    ties.


 Use with SCO TCP/IP and LAN Manager

    The SCO TCP/IP 1.1.3 netstat -i command does not give information on
    input packets, input errors, output packets, output errors, and colli-
    sions for some drivers in this version of the SCO LLI Drivers Package .
    You can get these statistics using the llistat command.

    LAN Manager uses NetBIOS, and if NetBIOS cannot get statistics using
    netstat -i, it fails with the following error message when you start mul-
    tiuser:

       netbios: cannot find host_name in /etc/hosts
       netbios: aborted

    In this example, host_name represents the variable NB_HOST from
    /etc/default/nbconf.  This variable is normally the local machine name.
    (This error could also result from an improperly configured etc/hosts or
    improper nameserver configuration.)

    To avoid this problem when you use LAN Manager over SCO TCP/IP 1.1.3 with
    this version of the SCO LLI drivers, install the SCO TCP/IP netstat Main-
    tenance Supplement. See the netstat supplement's Release and Installation
    Notes for details on the supplement's purpose and for installation
    instructions.


 Co-resident IPX/SPX and OSI or LAN Manager protocol stacks

    Because the framing for an IPX/SPX is user configurable to either 802.3
    or Ethernet II, it may be set to use the same framing as either NetBEUI
    or OSI. If it is set to use 802.3 framing, you may not drive both IPX/SPX
    and either LAN Manager or OSI over the same card. To be able to drive
    both IPX/SPX and either LAN Manager or OSI over the same card you must
    set IPX/SPX to use Ethernet II framing.  For more information see the SCO
    IPX/SPX Release and Installation Notes


 sio interrupt vectors under MPX

    The sio driver uses interrupt vectors 3 and 4.  You can assign either of
    these interrupt vectors to another driver, but if you assign both 3 and 4
    to other drivers, you remove the sio driver from the Link Kit.  On a sys-
    tem running SCO MPX, you cannot link the kernel if the sio driver is
    removed.  You get an error message similar to the following when you try
    to relink:

    _________________________________________________________________________
    undefined       first referenced
    symbol             in file
    sio_tty         /etc/conf/pack.d/crllry/Driver.o
    ld fatal: Symbol referencing errors. No output
    written to unix
    _________________________________________________________________________


    If you get this error message, use the following procedure to restore the
    sio device.  See the section ``Sample Driver Configuration'' earlier in
    these release notes for complete instructions on the mkdev and netconfig
    utilities mentioned below.

    1.  Reboot the machine.

    2.  Enter System Maintenance (single-user) mode by typing the root pass-
        word.

        The super user has access to all the system files, so be careful not
        to overwrite, delete, or corrupt any files by accident.

    3.  If you are running SCO TCP/IP 1.1.3, enter the following command:

           mkdev driver_name.

        Here, driver_name is the name of an LLI driver that uses an sio
        interrupt vector.

        If you are not running SCO TCP/IP 1.1.3, enter the following command:

           netconfig


    4.  If you are using mkdev, enter r to remove the driver.  A message asks
        whether you want to restore the vector to the sio device.

        If you are using netconfig, enter 2 to remove a chain of protocol
        elements.  You see a list of chains currently configured on the sys-
        tem.  Enter the number that appears in front of the chain that you
        want to remove.  After netconfig completely removes the chain, a
        message asks whether you want to restore the vector to the sio de-
        vice.

    5.  Enter y to restore the vector to the sio device.

        If you are using mkdev, you see a prompt to relink the kernel after
        you remove the conflicting driver.  To save time, do not relink the
        kernel until you reconfigure the driver you removed.  After you
        answer n to relinking the kernel, mkdev exits and you return to the
        command line.

        If you are using netconfig, you see the original menu that prompts
        you to add or remove a chain or to quit.

    6.  If you are using mkdev, run the mkdev driver_name command again to
        add the driver you removed.  Remember to use an interrupt vector that
        does not conflict with the sio driver.

        If you are using netconfig, enter a to add a chain that includes the
        driver you removed.  Remember to use an interrupt vector that does
        not conflict with the sio driver.

    7.  When you finish all your changes, relink the kernel.  If you are
        using netconfig, you must enter q to quit before you can relink.

    8.  If you are using SCO TCP/IP 1.1.3, run mkdev tcp after you relink the
        kernel.  Refer to your SCO TCP/IP Release and Installation Notes for
        instructions on this command.

    9.  When you finish, you must reconfigure the card itself.  If your card
        is software configurable, run the card configuration routine.  If
        your card is not software configurable, you must reconfigure the card
        by hand.



 Spontaneous reboot with some 3Com 523 cards

    On a 486 Microchannel machine after several hours under heavy load, the
    3Com 523 EtherLink/MC card may cause the system to panic or spontaneously
    reboot.  This problem is much more likely to occur when the card is used
    with Microsoft LAN Manager for UNIX Systems Release 1.1 and the Microsoft
    LAN Manager for UNIX Systems Release 1.1 Performance Supplement.


 Reinstalling SCO LLI Drivers Package  after SCO TCP/IP 1.1.3

    If you install SCO TCP/IP 1.1.3 after NetBEUI, you must reinstall the SCO
    LLI Drivers Package  after SCO TCP/IP.  The drivers with SCO TCP/IP
    overwrite the existing LLI drivers, but do not support OSI or NetBEUI.
    This is not a problem with SCO TCP/IP 1.2.0 and above.






 Appendix A
 mkdev TCP/IP sample driver configuration

    This appendix presents a sample configuration showing how to use mkdev to
    configure an Excelan driver on SCO TCP/IP 1.1.3.  The procedure for any
    driver is similar, with some differences depending on the networking
    cards that you are configuring for your network.

    You must use the mkdev utility if you are running SCO TCP/IP Release
    1.1.3, because this version of TCP/IP does not use netconfig.

    Follow these steps to configure your network with mkdev:

    1.  Reboot the machine.

    2.  Enter System Maintenance (single-user) mode by typing the root pass-
        word.

        The super user has access to all the system files, so be careful not
        to overwrite, delete, or corrupt any files by accident.

    3.  Type mkdevexos at the command line and press Return.

        You see the following prompt:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       Add (configure) or remove the exos driver or q
       to quit (a/r/q):

        _________________________________________________________________________



    4.  Enter a to add the driver.

        You see these messages:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       Configuring Excelan 205 Ethernet Adapter 0
       Installing the exos driver into the Link Kit
       Enter IRQ (2 3 4 5 6 7) [2] or 'q' to quit:

        _________________________________________________________________________


        The numbers in parentheses are the valid vector numbers, and the num-
        ber in square brackets is the default.

    5.  Press Return to select the default value, or type in the desired num-
        ber and press Return.

        If you choose an interrupt vector that conflicts with another device,
        you see a message similar to the following:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       Interrupt vector 3 is already in use for the sio
       device.
       The alternatives available to you are:
          1. Continue the installation and remove vector
               3 for the sio device.
          2. Select a different interrupt vector.
       Select an option (1 2) [1] or 'q' to quit:

        _________________________________________________________________________


        If you enter 1, you see this message:

    _________________________________________________________________________
    Removing interrupt vector 3 for the sio
    device ...
        _________________________________________________________________________

        If you enter 2, you again see the prompt in step 2.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  If you assign both sio interrupt vectors 3 and 4 to other
           drivers, you remove the sio driver from the Link Kit.  On a
           system running SCO MPX, you cannot link the kernel if the sio
           driver is removed.  To correct this problem, use mkdev or
           netconfig to remove one of the drivers that uses an sio inter-
           rupt vector and reassign that vector to the sio device.  Then
           reconfigure the driver you removed, using a different interrupt
           vector.

           For details on this problem and the workaround, see the section
           ``sio Interrupt Vectors under MPX'' in these release notes.
        _________________________________________________________________________

        Once you choose an interrupt vector, you are similarly prompted for
        the I/O base address and the RAM base address.  In each case, press
        Return to select the default value, or type in the desired number and
        press Return.

    6.  Finally, you are asked if you wish to relink the kernel. To save
        time, do not relink the kernel until you have added all the drivers
        that you want to use on your system.  If you choose not to relink the
        kernel, you return to the command line.

        If you enter y to relink the kernel, a message confirms that choice.
        Then, you see this prompt:
    _________________________________________________________________________
       Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n)
        _________________________________________________________________________


    7.  Enter y. You see several messages, including:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)

        _________________________________________________________________________



    8.  Enter y.  This procedure takes a few minutes. When the rebuild is
        complete, you return to the command line.


    If you are running TCP/IP 1.1.3, when you finish configuring all of the
    driver cards you need, run mkdevtcp to configure TCP/IP.  Refer to your
    SCO TCP/IP Release and Installation Notes for instructions on this com-
    mand.





 Appendix B
 netconfig NetBEUI sample driver configuration

    This appendix presents a sample configuration showing how to use netcon-
    fig to configure LAN Manager Client over a Microsoft NetBEUI transport
    stack.  The procedure for any driver is similar, with some differences
    depending on the networking cards that you are configuring for your net-
    work.

    Follow these steps to configure your network with netconfig:

    1.  Reboot the machine.

    2.  Enter System Maintenance (single-user) mode by typing the root pass-
        word.

        The super user has access to all the system files, so be careful not
        to overwrite, delete, or corrupt any files by accident.

    3.  At the system prompt, enter the following and press Return:

           netconfig

        The following messages appear while the selected chain is configured:

    _________________________________________________________________________
    Adding: lmxc->nbe->e3A0
    Configuring 3Com501 board 0
        _________________________________________________________________________


        You also see driver-specific prompts, which vary depending on the
        network adapter you choose in step 5.

    9.  Respond to the driver-specific prompts.  For instructions on respond-
        ing to these prompts, see the sections ``Configuration Overview'' and
        ``IBM Token Ring Driver'' earlier in these release notes.

        After you respond to all of the driver-specific prompts, netconfig
        begins configuring the specified chain of products.  You see a series
        of messages indicating the progress of the configuration.

        After netconfig configures the chain of products, the following
        prompt appears:
    _________________________________________________________________________
    Do you want to start the LMX Client every time you
    go multiuser (y/n)
        _________________________________________________________________________



    10. If you want LAN Manager Client to start every time you leave system-
        maintenance mode, enter y, then press Return.  Otherwise, enter n,
        then press Return.

        The following messages and prompts appear:

     2. Remove a chain
     q. Quit
    Select option:
        _________________________________________________________________________



    11. If you wish to add another chain, select option 1 and repeat the
        netconfig procedure.

        After you configure all the drivers that you want on your system,
        enter q to quit netconfig.

    12. Finally, you are asked if you wish to relink the kernel. To save
        time, wait to relink the kernel until you install all the software
        that you plan to install at this time.  If you choose not to relink
        the kernel (by entering n), you return to the command line.

        If you enter y to relink the kernel, a message confirms that choice.
        Then, you see this prompt:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n)

        _________________________________________________________________________




    13. Enter y. You see several messages, including:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)

        _________________________________________________________________________




    14. Enter y.  This procedure takes a few minutes. When the rebuild is
        complete, you return to the command line.


    The LAN Manager Administrator's Guide lists all possible entries and
    values for the Microsoft NetBEUI tunable parameters, including default
    options for the Microsoft NetBEUI tunable parameters.  The guide also

 Appendix C
 netconfig OSI  sample driver configuration

    This appendix presents a sample configuration showing how to use netcon-
    fig to configure LT-610  over a Western Digital Driver.  The procedure
    for any driver is similar, with some differences depending on the net-
    working cards that you are configuring for your network.

    Follow these steps to configure your network with netconfig:

    1.  Reboot the machine.

    2.  Enter System Maintenance (single-user) mode by typing the root pass-
        word.

        The super user has access to all the system files, so be careful not
        to overwrite, delete, or corrupt any files by accident.

    3.  At the system prompt, enter the following and press Return:

           netconfig

        A listing of configured chains appears, followed by a menu of
        options.  If no chains are configured, you see the following:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       No chains configured:
       Available options:

         1. Add a chain
         2. Remove a chain
         q. Quit
       Select option:

        _________________________________________________________________________



        If you already had a chain configured, such as SCO TCP/IP over a
        Western Digital 8013 network adapter card, you would see something
        like the following:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       Currently configured chains:
        1. tcp-ip->wdn0
            tcp-ip  SCO TCP/IP Runtime System for SCO Unix
            wdn0    Western Digital 8003/8013 Series driver,
                    board 0

       Available options:
         1. Add a chain
         2. Remove a chain
         q. Quit
       Select option:

        _________________________________________________________________________

    4.  Enter 1 to select the Add a Chain option, then press Return.

        A list of available top-level products appears, as in the following
        example, which depicts the situation in which SCO/RETIX LT-610 , SCO
        NetBIOS, and SCO TCP/IP all happen to be available for configuration
        over your network adapter card:
    _________________________________________________________________________
    Num Name    Description
     1. lt610    Retix OSI LT-610 Lower Layers
     2. netbios  SCO NetBIOS Runtime System for SCO Unix
     3. sco_tcp  SCO TCP/IP Runtime System for SCO Unix
    Select top level of chain to Add or q to quit:
        _________________________________________________________________________



        The list you actually see reflects the products available on your
        system.

    5.  To add a chain using LT-610  from the example list, enter 1, then
        press Return.

        You are prompted to choose a network driver from a list similar to
        the following:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       Num Name  Description
         1. E3A   3Com 501 Driver
         2. E3B   3Com 503 Driver

         9. I6E   NI6510 Racal Interlan Driver
        10. TOK   IBM Token Ring Network Adapter driver
        11. WDN   Western Digital 8003/8013 Series driver
       Select next level of chain to Add or q to quit:

        _________________________________________________________________________



        The list of drivers actually displayed reflects the software
        currently installed on your system.

    6.  Enter the number corresponding to the network adapter over which you
        wish to configure LT-610 , then press Return.  The remainder of this
        sample procedure describes the screens that you see if you choose
        item number 8.

        The following prompt asks you to confirm the selected product chain:

    _________________________________________________________________________
    Add chain lt610->wdn0 (y/n):
        _________________________________________________________________________


    7.  If the displayed product chain is correct, type y, then press Return.
        If the chain is incorrect, type n, then press Return to return to the
        netconfig main menu.  You can then either quit netconfig or add a
        different chain of products.

        If you type y in response to the previous prompt, you see the follow-
        ing messages while the selected chain is being configured:

    _________________________________________________________________________
    Adding: lt610->wdn0
    Configuring Western Digital 8003/8013 Series driver,
    board 0
        _________________________________________________________________________


        You may also see driver-specific prompts, which vary depending on the
        network adapter you choose in step 5.  If you see any such prompts,
        respond to them.

        For instructions on how to respond to these prompts, see the sections
        ``Configuration Overview'' and ``IBM Token Ring Driver'' earlier in
        these release notes.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  Please consult the SCO/Retix OSI /LT-610 Installation
           Instructions for additional information that may be of help
           while you perform steps 8 through 13.
        _________________________________________________________________________


    8.  The Network Service Configuration menu appears, and is similar to the
        following example:

    _________________________________________________________________________

                        Network Services Configuration
       1. ESIS support for end systems configuration ( default )
       2. ESIS support for intermediate systems configuration
       3. No ESIS support, static routing tables for end system configuration
       3. No ESIS support, static routing tables for intermediate system
          configuration

        _________________________________________________________________________




    9.  Enter the number that corresponds to the configuration you want.

        The following prompt appears:

    _________________________________________________________________________
    Network Entity Title address:
        _________________________________________________________________________



    10. Enter the Network Entity Title that you have obtained for this sys-
        tem.

        Note that every system on the network requires a unique Network
        Entity Title and at least one unique NSAP address.

    11. The following prompt appears:

    _________________________________________________________________________
    Number of NSAP addresses  [1]:
        _________________________________________________________________________


        Enter the number of NSAP addresses assigned to your system.

    12. Enter each NSAP address as a continuous string of hexadecimal digits.
        Do not include any spaces, periods, or other punctuation in the
        address.

        The drivers are installed in the kernel.

        Note that, if you chose to install an Intermediate System in step 8,
        you are now given the option of installing WAN support. Once that is
        done, you continue with the next step.

    13. The following prompt appears:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       Would you like the lower layers started
       when the system boots? (y n)

        _________________________________________________________________________



        If you enable automatic startup by entering y at this prompt, the
        executable script file /etc/rc2.d/S40osi is created.  This script
        runs automatically whenever the system is booted.  It consists of a
        single command that starts LT-610 .

    14. Press Return when instructed.

        At this point, netconfig begins configuring the specified chain of
        products.  You see a series of messages indicating the progress of
        the configuration, including the automatic configuration of various
        STREAMS parameters.

        Assuming that you already have SCO TCP/IP configured over the same
        card over which you just configured LT-610 , you see messages and
        prompts similar to the following:

    _________________________________________________________________________
    Currently configured chains:
     1. tcp-ip->wdn0
         tcp-ip  SCO TCP/IP Runtime System for SCO Unix
         wdn0    Western Digital 8003/8013 Series driver,
                   board 0
     2. lt610->wdn0
         lt610 Retix OSI LT-610 Lower Layers
         wdn0  Western Digital 8003/8013 Series driver,
                 board 0

    Available options:
     1. Add a chain
     2. Remove a chain
     q. Quit
    Select option:
        _________________________________________________________________________



    15. Select q to quit the netconfig menu, and confirm the exit with
        Return.

    16. Finally, you are asked if you wish to relink the kernel. Enter y to
        relink the kernel.

        A message confirms that choice. Then, you see the following prompt:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n)

        _________________________________________________________________________




    17. Enter y. You see several messages, including:

    _________________________________________________________________________

       Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)

        _________________________________________________________________________




    18. Enter y.

        This procedure takes a few minutes. When the rebuild is complete, you
        are returned to the command line.  LT-610  is now configured over
        your selected network adapter card driver.






 e3dsetup(ADM)                                                  e3dsetup(ADM)



 Name

    e3dsetup - configures 3Com EtherLink 16 (3c507) network adapter cards

 Syntax


    e3dsetup         -help
    e3dsetup        [-io:base I/O address]
                    [-irq:IRQ line]
                    [-conn:aui | bnc]
                    [-ram:RAM window starting address]

                    [-zerowait:e | d]
                    [-data:data addressing mode]


 Description

    The e3dsetup command configures 3Com EtherLink 16 network adapter cards.
    For your protection, this command can be run only by the superuser.  See
    the ``Warnings'' section for a description of the issues to be aware of
    before running this command.
    Be aware that no more than one Etherlink 16 adapter card at a time can be
    physically installed in your computer while you are configuring the card.
    After you have configured all of your network adapter cards, you can
    install as many as four of them in your computer, provided that you have
    assigned each of them a unique base I/O address and a unique IRQ line.
    You should also make sure that the RAM window and the boot ROM address
    spaces, if defined, do not overlap address spaces defined for other
    adapter cards or devices.  See the -ram, -ramsize, -rom, and -romsize
    options for more information.
    If you install more than one Etherlink 16 card and later wish to recon-
    figure some or all of them, you must remove all but one of the cards
    before configuring the remaining card. Once you have configured the one
    card and wish to configure the others, you must remove the card just con-
    figured and install the next card to be configured.  Proceed in this
    manner until all Etherlink 16 cards (up to four) have been configured.
    Once the last card has been configured, the remaining cards can be rein-
    stalled.
    When power to the computer is turned on, the contents of the EEPROM chip
    on board the network adapter card is loaded into the configuration regis-
    ters of the card.  These registers occupy three consecutive I/O
    addresses.  The first of these addresses is offset thirteen memory loca-
    tions beyond the base I/O address configured for the card.  In other
    words, the first address equals the base I/O address plus hexadecimal 0D.

    To display or change adapter card configurations interactively, enter the
    e3dsetup command with no options.  The command begins by attempting to
    find all software configurable cards (up to four) installed in the com-
    puter and which have base I/O addresses within the range from hexadecimal
    200 through 3E0.  If more than one 3Com Etherlink 16 adapter card is
    found, the e3dsetup command prints the current configurations for all of
    them, then prints a warning message and exits.  If, however, you have
    only one EtherLink 16 network adapter card installed, the command dis-
    plays the configuration of that card and prompts you to change the con-
    figuration. If you wish to change the configuration of the adapter card,
    enter y.  If you do not wish to change the configuration, enter n.
    If you enter y, the command presents each configuration option in
    sequence and displays its current value.  If you wish to change the con-
    figuration value for that option, enter the new value and press Return.
    If you wish to retain the displayed value for that option, simply press
    Return.
    To change the configuration of an adapter card from the command line,
    enter the following:

       e3dsetup [options]

    The command first verifies that there is only one 3Com Etherlink 16
    adapter card installed in the computer with a base I/O address in the
    range from hexadecimal 200 through 3E0 inclusive.  If more than one card
    is found, e3dsetup prints the current configurations for all the cards
    found, then prints a warning message and exits. If only one card is
    found, the command reads the options and their values, verifies that the
    values specified are valid, and changes the configuration values as
    specified by the options. All omitted options retain their current
    values.

 Options


    -data          specifies whether 8 or 16 bit data transfers are used.
                   Acceptable values for this options are standard for 8-bit
                   data transfer and turbo for 16-bit data transfer. Note
                   that the 3c507 card does not work in 16-bit mode with some
                   motherboard chip sets.  If your 3c507 card does not work
                   in 16 bit mode, try the 8-bit mode

    -help          displays the help screen.

    -io            specifies the base I/O address for the network adapter
                   card.  The address must be specified using three hexade-
                   cimal digits, lie in the range from 200 through 3E0
                   inclusive, and be a multiple of hexadecimal 10.  In other
                   words, legal addresses are 200, 210, 220, and so forth.
                   However, the following addresses are not allowed, even
                   though they follow the rules just described: 2F0, 370,
                   3B0, 3C0, and 3D0.

    -irq           specifies the Interrupt Request (IRQ) line to be used by
                   the network adapter card. Acceptable values for this
                   option are 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15.  Be aware that
                   network adapter cards prior to Revision 04 do not support
                   IRQ 11.

    -conn          specifies the type of physical connection to be used
                   between the network adapter card and the network.  Accept-
                   able values for this option are aui (thick Ethernet,
                   external transceiver) or bnc (thin Ethernet, on-board
                   transceiver).

    -ram           specifies the starting address of the RAM window.  The RAM
                   window is memory on the adapter card that is mapped into
                   the physical address space of the computer.  Acceptable
                   values for this option are:  C0000, C8000, D0000, D8000,
                   F00000, F20000, F40000, F60000 or F80000.  Note that
                   addresses above D0000 limit acceptable values of the -
                   ramsize options.  See the -ramsize option for more infor-
                   mation.  This option is used in conjunction with the -
                   ramsize option to fully specify the address space of the
                   RAM window.

    -ramsize       specifies the size of the RAM window in Kbytes. The RAM
                   window is memory on the adapter card that is mapped into
                   the physical address space of the computer.  In general,
                   acceptable values for this option are 16, 32, 48, and 64.
                   However, if you specify a RAM window starting address of
                   D8000, the only acceptable values are 16 or 32.  Further-
                   more, if you specify a RAM window starting address of
                   F00000 or greater, the only acceptable value is 64.  This
                   option is used in conjunction with the -ram option to
                   fully specify the address space of the RAM window.  Note
                   that the address space of the RAM window cannot overlap
                   address spaces defined for other adapter cards or other
                   devices.

    -rom           specifies the starting address of the boot ROM.  The
                   address must be a hexadecimal value in the range from
                   C0000 through DE000.  Further, the address must be an
                   integral multiple of hexadecimal 2000.  In other words,
                   legal addresses are C0000, C2000, C4000, and so forth.

    -romsize       specifies the size of the boot ROM in Kbytes.  Acceptable
                   values for this option are 0, 16, 32, or 64. Specify a
                   size of 0 if the adapter card has no boot ROM or if you
                   wish to disable the boot ROM.

    -zerowait      specifies whether or not the adapter card is to use zero
                   wait states for RAM access.  Wait states, if used, effec-
                   tively slow down the data transfer rate of the RAM on
                   board the adapter card.  Zero wait states means that no
                   wait states are used and RAM accesses occur at full speed.
                   Acceptable values for this option are d for disable and e
                   for enable. If you specify d, wait states are added.  If
                   you specify e, no wait states are added.


 Warnings

    You are strongly urged to run this program in single user mode only.  The
    purpose of this precaution is to avoid problems that might arise from
    specifying an incorrect base I/O address for the network adapter card or
    from specifying a baseI/O address or IRQ that is already being used by
    another adapter card or device. It is also important that no part of the
    RAM and ROM address spaces defined for the network adapter card overlap
    address spaces defined for other adapter cards or other devices.  This
    includes devices such as small built-in LED or LCD displays used to show
    disk cylinder data or CPU clock speed.

 lliconfig(ADM)                                                lliconfig(ADM)



 Name

    lliconfig - displays all LLI drivers currently configured on the system

 Syntax

    lliconfig

 Description

    The lliconfig utility lets you see which LLI drivers are currently con-
    figured on your system.  lliconfig displays each driver board's name,
    interrupt vector, IO address, and RAM address (if any).  The utility also
    shows how the LLI chains are configured.

 Examples

    Here is the sample output from lliconfig:

       The following LLI drivers are configured:
            Board   Interrupt   IO Addr    RAM Addr     DMA Channel
            e3B0    3           300        0-0            none
            wdn0    2 (9)       240        d0000-d1fff    none

       The following LLI chains are configured:
            Driver           Configured under
            e3B0                     netconfig (nbe)
            wdn0                     mkdev


    In this example, the 0-0 in the RAM address column for the e3B0 board
    indicates that the board does not have a RAM address.  The (9) in the
    interrupt vector column for the wdn0 board indicates that interrupt vec-
    tor 2 is sometimes referred to as 9.

 llistat(ADM)                                                    llistat(ADM)



 Name

    llistat - displays LLI driver statistics

 Syntax

    llistat [-s] [-l] [device name]

 Description

    The llistat utility provides a standard method of displaying statistics:

    +  to verify your driver board's name and address,

    +  to verify that your driver board is installed correctly, and

    +  to check for network problems.

    llistat displays each driver board's name and address, the Multicast
    address table, the number of frames that have gone in and out, the number
    of frames with errors, and the number of collisions (if any).

    Here is the sample output from llistat:

       Device       SNPA/MAC address    Factory Address
       /dev/e3B0    02:60:8c:3c:2f:4a   02:60:8c:3c:2f:4a
               Multicast address table
               Frames:      In      Out  Errs In  Err out Collisions
                        172999      750        0        0         10


    In this example, /dev/e3B0 in the Device column indicates the name of the
    lli device.  The 02:60:8c:3e:2f:4a in the SNPA/MAC address column indi-
    cates the address currently in use on the driver board.  The similar num-
    bers in the Factory Address column indicates the built-in address
    assigned by the board manufacturers.  These two addresses are often the
    same.  The Multicast address table gives the multicast address in the
    same form.  In this example, the driver board is not using a multicast
    address and the table is empty.  The columns in the Frames row indicate
    the number of frames that have gone into and out of the board, the number
    of frames that have gone in and out with errors, and the number of colli-
    sions.  Frames that have collisions are re-sent.  You can expect to have
    a few errors, but you might have a network problem if a large percentage
    of frames have gone in and out with errors.

 Options


    -s             verifies the device name only.

    -l             displays all available statistics, one statistic to a
                   line.

    device name    allows you to specify a single device name.  If you do not
                   use this option and there is more than one lli device con-
                   figuration, llistat shows you the configuration for all of
                   the devices.

 wdnsetup(ADM)                                                  wdnsetup(ADM)



 Name

    wdnsetup - configures Western Digital network adapter cards

 Syntax


    wdnsetup -v
    wdnsetup -help
    wdnsetup -factory
    wdnsetup -default

    wdnsetup [-node:node address | -io:base I/O address]

    wdnsetup -node:node address [configuration options]
    wdnsetup -io:base I/O address [configuration options]


 Description

    The wdnsetup command configures supported Western Digital network adapter
    cards. For your protection, this command can be run only by the
    superuser.  See the ``Warnings'' section for a description of the issues
    to be aware of before running this command.

    If you enter the wdnsetup command without any options, the command begins
    by attempting to find all software configurable cards (up to four)
    installed in the computer and which have base I/O addresses within the
    range from hexadecimal 200 through 3E0.  It then displays the configura-
    tion of each card, and prompts you to change the configuration.  If you
    do not wish to change configurations, enter q (or n if you have only one
    adapter card installed).

    If you do wish to change the configuration of an adapter card, enter the
    number of that card (or simply enter y if you have only one card
    installed).  The command presents each configuration option in sequence
    and displays its current value.  If you wish to change the value, enter
    the new value and press Return.  Otherwise, just press Return.

    To display or modify the configuration of a single adapter card, enter
    its base I/O address or Ethernet node address as follows:

       wdnsetup -io:base I/O address

    or

       wdnsetup -node:node address

    The command presents each configuration option in sequence and displays
    its current value for the specified card.  If you wish to change the
    value, enter the new value and press Return.  Otherwise, just press
    Return.
    To change the configuration values of a single adapter card all from the
    command line, enter the following:

       wdnsetup -io:base I/O address [configuration options]

    or

       wdnsetup -node:node address [configuration options]

    For each configuration option specified, the new value replaces the
    current value.  Omitted options retain their current values.

    You can install as many as four network adapter cards in your computer,
    provided that you have assigned each of them both a unique base I/O
    address and a unique IRQ line.

 Configuration options


    -newio         specifies the new base I/O address in hexadecimal for a
                   network adapter card. The address must be in the range
                   from hexadecimal 200 through 3E0 and must be a multiple of
                   hexadecimal 20. In other words, legal addresses are 200,
                   220, 240, and so forth.  When power to the computer is
                   turned on, the contents of the EEROM chips on board the
                   adapter card are loaded into the internal registers of the
                   WD83C583 or WD83C584 Bus Interface Controller Device.
                   These registers occupy eight consecutive I/O addresses,
                   starting at the base I/O address configured for the
                   adapter card.

    -irq           specifies the Interrupt Request (IRQ) line to be used by
                   the network adapter card. This option also has the effect
                   of enabling the IRQ line specified.  Acceptable values for
                   this option are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, and 15.  Note that
                   IRQ 2 maps into IRQ 9.  Also, be aware that some adapter
                   cards do not support all of the above values.

    -ram           specifies the starting address of the RAM window.  The RAM
                   window is the RAM on board the adapter card that is mapped
                   into the physical address space of the computer.  The
                   address must be a hexadecimal value in the range from
                   80000 through FE000. Also, the address must be an integral
                   multiple of -ramsize. See the -ramsize option for more in-
                   formation.  For 8013 adapter cards, recall that addresses
                   above 1 Megabyte are specified with six hexadecimal
                   digits.

    -ramsize       specifies the size of the RAM window in Kbytes. The RAM
                   window is the RAM on board the adapter card that is mapped
                   into the physical address space of the computer.  Accept-
                   able values for this option are 8 and 16.  The starting
                   address of the RAM window is specified with the -ram
                   option. The address space of the RAM window, defined by
                   the -ramsize and -ram options, must be reserved for a
                   given adapter card and not overlap address spaces defined
                   for other adapter cards or devices.

    -rom           specifies the base address of the boot ROM.  The address
                   must be a hexadecimal value in the range from 80000
                   through FC000.  Also, the address must be an integral mul-
                   tiple of -romsize.   This option is ignored if -romsize is
                   0.

    -romsize       specifies the size of the boot ROM in Kbytes.  Acceptable
                   values for this option 0, 16, 32, or 64. Specify a size of
                   0 if the adapter card has no boot ROM or if you wish to
                   disable it.  The address space for the boot ROM, defined
                   by the -romsize and -rom options, must be reserved for a
                   given adapter card and not overlap address spaces defined
                   for other adapter cards or devices.

    -wait          specifies whether or not the adapter card is to use zero
                   wait states for RAM access.  Acceptable values for this
                   option are y for yes and n for no. If you specify y, wait
                   states are added to effectively slow down the data
                   transfer rate of the RAM on board the adapter card.  If
                   you specify n, no wait states are added.

    -netconn       specifies the type of physical connection to be used
                   between the network adapter card and the network.  This
                   option must be used for those cards that lack a hardware
                   jumper for this purpose.  Acceptable values for this
                   option are 1 (BNC or 10BaseT), 2 (AUI or 10BaseT), and 3
                   (Twisted Pair with No Link Integrity).

    -link_int      specifies whether Link Integrity is enabled or disabled.
                   Acceptable values for this option are e (enabled) or d
                   (disabled).  This option cannot be used with WD8013WC and
                   WD8013EWC network adapter cards.  For these adapter cards,
                   use the -netconn option instead of the -link_int option.


 Other options


    -v             displays the version number of this command.

    -help          displays the help screen.

    -node          specifies the Ethernet node address in hexadecimal of a
                   network adapter card.

    -io            specifies the current base I/O address in hexadecimal for
                   a network adapter card.

    -factory       forces the adapter card to the factory configuration.
                   This option overrides all other options except -default.
                   The factory configuration is the same as the default con-
                   figuration, except that interrupts are disabled.  See the
                   table following the -default option for more information.

    -default       forces the adapter card to its default configuration.
                   This option overrides all other options, including -
                   factory.


 Notes

    Depending on the cards you are installing, you may have to set hardware
    jumpers to allow the configuration settings you specify with wdnsetup to
    take effect.  Consult the documentation accompanying your adapter card
    for more information.

 Warnings

    You are strongly urged to run this program in single user mode only.  The
    purpose of this precaution is to avoid problems that might arise from
    specifying an incorrect base I/O address for a network adapter card or
    from specifying a baseI/O address that is already being used by some
    other device. If multiple adapters cards are to be configured, it is
    recommended that you configure them one at a time to reduce the chance of
    configuring more than one card with the same base I/O address. It is also
    important that no part of the RAM and ROM address spaces defined for a
    given network adapter card be shared with either other adapter cards or
    any other device.  This includes devices such as small built-in LED or
    LCD displays used to show disk cylinder data or CPU clock speed.
