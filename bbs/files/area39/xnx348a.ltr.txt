Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) xnx348a provides a SCSI Badblock 
Utility called scsibadblk(ADM).  This utility is similar in functionality to 
badtrk(ADM), but must only be used to detect or replace badblocks on SCSI 
diskettes.

SLS xnx348a will install the scsibadblk(ADM) utility, and a man page for the 
utility, onto your system.  It also installs modified SCSI drivers that need 
to be linked into the SCO XENIX kernel. 

SLS xnx348a will prompt for the installation of the Link kit as part of the 
installation of the SLS.

SLS xnx348a will only install on SCO XENIX 386 Operating System Release 2.3.4.

SLS xnx348a is custom(ADM) installable and removable and consists of a single
floppy volume.
