Dear Customer,

Enclosed please find a diskette containing Support Level Supplement
xnx120, which installs the new /bin/ps file for your SCO XENIX
386 Operating System Release 2.3.0 and 2.3.1.  This new file
corrects a problem with "seek errors" exhibited by ps.  Seek
errors will still occur and are a normal part of operation, but
they should occur infrequently.   

To install this file, please enter system maintenance
mode and type the following command:

# /etc/install <CR>

You will then be prompted to insert the diskette.  The install
program will save the old version of /bin/ps as /bin/ps-, and
install the new version as /bin/ps.

After the file has been extracted you may bring the system
up in multiuser mode.

Yours sincerely,


Technical Support Department
