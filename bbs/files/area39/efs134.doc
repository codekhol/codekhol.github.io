    Conventions used in this document

    These notes use the following notational conventions:

    bold      represents commands, command options, and special keys that you
              press.  For example, xset -bc is a complete command line that
              is executed when you press <Return>.  <Ctrl>x means to hold
              down the Control key and press the x key, then release them.

    italics   represents files and directories, as well as variables that you
              supply.  For example, in the command argument path:pathname,
              you replace pathname with an actual pathname when you type the
              command.



 Release information

    SCO Open Desktop, Release 2.0, and the SCO Open Desktop, Release 2.0, De-
    velopment System both utilize the X11R4 version of the X Window System(r)
    libraries and version 1.1.4 of the OSF/Motif(r) libraries so that graphi-
    cal applications created by the development system can run on the operat-
    ing system. Similarly, SCO Open Desktop, Release 3.0, and its accompany-
    ing development system, both utilize the X11R5 version of the X Window
    System and version 1.2.1 of the OSF/Motif libraries.  However, if a
    graphical applications developer takes advantage of the new features in
    the SCO Open Desktop, Release 3.0, Development System, to develop new
    applications, the applications created may not be able to run on SCO Open
    Desktop, Release 2.0.  This EFS is designed to enable SCO Open Desktop,
    Release 2.0, to run such applications.

    This EFS includes the following files:

    /shlib/libX11R5_s
                contains the X11R5 Xlib shared library

    /shlib/libXtXm1.2_s
                contains the X11R5 X Toolkit Intrinsics and OSF/Motif Version
                1.2.1 routines

    /usr/lib/X11/C/Codeset
                provides the standard default codeset information for C,
                english_us.ascii, C_C.C, and english $LANG environments

    /usr/lib/X11/XErrorDB
                contains the X11R5 version of the error message database

    /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB
                contains the virtual keysym database used by SCO Open Desk-
                top, Release 3.0

    /usr/bin/X11/mwm
                contains a new version of the Motif Window Manager (mwm),
                Release 1.1.4 with improvements, to correctly manage applica-
                tions built with OSF/Motif Version 1.2.1 and X11R5



 Installing the EFS

    When you install this EFS some files in the /usr/bin/X11 and /usr/lib/X11
    directories are replaced with updated files. The files that previously
    existed in these directories (XErrorDB, XKeysymDB, and mwm) are automati-
    cally backed up during installation and saved in the
    /usr/lib/custom/save/xrtefs directory.
