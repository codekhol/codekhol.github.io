Dear SCO Customer,

Support Level Supplement (SLS) UOD426C corrects various date-related
problems reported on SCO UNIX System V/386 and SCO Open Server based 
systems.  Note that this SLS _only_ applies to the products specified 
below.  A separate SLS is needed for SCO XENIX systems; contact your SCO 
supplier for more information. 

NOTE: Please remove any previous versions of UOD426 before installing
      UOD426C.

This SLS is intended for the following warranted operating system 
releases and affected warranted SCO products:

       SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.2
       SCO Open Server Enterprise System Release 3.0 
       SCO Open Server Network System Release 3.0 
       SCO Open Desktop Release 3.0 
       SCO Open Desktop Lite Release 3.0 
       SCO FoxBASE+ 386 Release 2.1.2


These operating system and other SCO products are not warranted by SCO 
and have not been extensively tested. However, SLS UOD426C should still 
work as expected:

       SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Version 4.1, 4.0, 2.0
       SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2.0 
       SCO Open Desktop Server System 1.1, 2.0
       SCO Open Desktop Server System Supplement 2.0
       SCO Open Desktop Personal System 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
       SCO Open Desktop Server Upgrade 1.0, 1.1
       Microsoft Word for UNIX Systems Release 5.1.1 
       SCO Portfolio Release 1.0.1, 2.0.0

SLS UOD426C resolves a number of separate and specific date-related problems, 
described below, in the above operating systems and SCO products.  Other 
SCO products, non-SCO applications, or SCO SLSs may be affected by the same 
date-related problems:

    1. The "century" problem

    Some binaries and utilities will not correctly recognize the switch over 
    from the 20th century to the 21st century when the system's date changes
    from 1999 to the year 2000. This will cause other utilities, such as 
    script asktime(ADM) which makes use of one or more of the affected 
    binaries and/or utilities, to incorrectly revert back to the beginning 
    of the 20th century.

    The binaries and utilities affected by this problem are:

     /bin/touch
     /bin/sddate
     /etc/setclock
     /lib/cvtdate
     /usr/bin/at

    To correct the century problem SLS UOD426C installs fixed versions
    of the binaries and utilities listed above.


    2.  The "leap year" problem

    Many commands and utilities do not display dates after February 28th,
    2000 correctly.  For example, running the following command to set the 
    date to Tuesday February 29th, 2000:

               # date 0229101000

    will set the date to Tuesday March 1st, 2000 instead.

    The affected binaries and utilities do not correctly recognize the 
    year 2000 as a leap year, hence a day is skipped over. The problem
    was found to be a bug in a version of an SCO development system library 
    used to build the affected binaries and utilities. 

    To correct this problem SLS UOD426C installs a binary patch, fix2000,
    which is run to find all affected binaries and utilities and patch 
    in the corrected code. 


    3.  Incorrect date in mail headers 

    On systems where the date is set to the year 2000 and beyond the date 
    reported in the mail headers will be incorrect. This problem is caused 
    by a bug in the libmmdf.a library. 

    To correct this problem SLS UOD426C installs fixed versions of the 
    affected mailer binaries. The mailer binaries affected by this problem
    are:

     /usr/bin/mail
     /usr/bin/mlist
     /usr/bin/rmail
     /usr/bin/rcvfile
     /usr/bin/rcvtrip
     /usr/bin/resend
     /usr/lib/mail/execmail
     /usr/lib/sendmail
     /usr/mmdf/bin/cleanque
     /usr/mmdf/bin/deliver
     /usr/mmdf/bin/oldlocal
     /usr/mmdf/bin/submit
     /usr/mmdf/bin/v6mail
     /usr/mmdf/chans/local


    4.  'passwd -s' 

    When the system's date is set to the year 2000 and a user's password
    is subsequently modified, the command 'passwd -s <user>' displays the 
    modification date as '01/01/100'.

    To correct this problem SLS UOD426C installs a fixed passwd(ADM)
    command.

  
    5.  The lp interface script 'standard' has the wrong date hard coded

    The lp interface script, 'standard', has the wrong date hard coded.
    The date is hard coded in 2 digits.

    To correct this problem SLS UOD426C installs a modified 'standard'
    interface script file with the date correctly coded to use 4 digits.


    6. SCCS delta/get functions do not handle dates in year 2000 correctly.

    When the system date is set to the year 2000 or beyond, and you insert a 
    new version of a program into SCCS, SCCS will subsequently display an 
    incorrect date for the insertion of the new program into SCCS and will
    report an error.

    To correct this problem SLS UOD426 installs fixed versions of a number
    of SCCS binaries. All SCCS binaries except for 'help' are affected. 
    The list of affected SCCS binaries is:

     /usr/bin/admin
     /usr/bin/cdc
     /usr/bin/comb
     /usr/bin/delta
     /usr/bin/get
     /usr/bin/prs
     /usr/bin/rmdel
     /usr/bin/sact
     /usr/bin/sccsdiff
     /usr/bin/unget
     /usr/bin/val
     /usr/bin/vc
     /usr/bin/what
 
    (NOTE: This problem will only be seen if the SCO UNIX System V/386
    Development System is installed on the system.)

 
 7. New enhancements to /bin/date(C) and /etc/asktime(ADM)

    SLS UOD426C also supplies an enhancement intended to synchronize the 
    real-time clock (RTC) and system clock at boot time with an improved 
    version of the /etc/asktime(ADM) shell script. It also provides the 
    user with a new utility, /bin/getclock, a function designed to read the 
    RTC to the nearest second, and an improved version of /bin/date(C) with 
    a new command line option, '-t, which allows setting the system clock 
    to the nearest second. 

    As shown in the RTC(HW) man page, the RTC contains a seconds register
    which can be read with the appropriate call to the RTC driver. Unlike
    setclock(ADM), which does not implement this functionality, the new 
    utility /bin/getclock reads the RTC including the seconds register and 
    prints this time to stdout in exactly the format that the new /bin/date(C)
    expects, namely YYMMDDHHMM.SS.

    Thus in the new /etc/asktime(ADM), the system clock is synced to the 
    RTC via the command:

     date -t 'getclock'

    to the nearest second. However, if the time needs to be reset  by the 
    administrator at the familiar "Enter new time ([yymmdd]hhmm):" prompt,
    the system clock is set to the nearest minute and the RTC is updated 
    accordingly, truncating the current value of the seconds register to 
    zero. This is adequate for most time-setting purposes, since rarely
    is it desired to set the system clock to the nearest second apart from
    referencing the RTC. 

    Note that /bin/date(C) retains its old functionality in its entirety.
    Thus typing "date MMDDHHMM[YY]" sets the date to the nearest minute. 
    The full range of specification of date setting with the '-t' option
    to /bin/date(C) includes the century according to the generalized 
    syntax:

     date -t [CC]YYMMDDHHMM[.SS]

    where the bracketed information is optional once '-t' has been chosen.
   

    NOTE: While SLS UOD426C installs a number of fixed and enhanced 
    utilities, most of the new utilities also suffer from the "leap-year" 
    problem and so will also require patching by fix2000(ADM). Thus SLS 
    UOD426C first replaces the broken utilities with the new versions 
    before running fix2000(ADM) on the new versions. On removal of SLS 
    UOD426C from the system, the original versions of the utilities are 
    replaced. 



INSTALLING SLS UOD426C

NOTE:  Please remove any preivous versions of UOD426 before installing
       UOD426C.

To install SLS UOD426C, follow the attached procedure.  It is important that
you read the "Notes" section first before installing SLS UOD426C. 


   1. Log in as "root" in single-user mode, or if already logged in,
      enter this command at the shell prompt:

            init 1 

   2. At the shell prompt, invoke custom(ADM):

            custom

      Insert the SLS floppy when prompted to do so.

   3. Choose the option:
   
            Install->A New Product->Entire Product
   
   4. At the following prompt:

            Insert SCO Year 2000 SLS
                 Floppy Volume 1

      check to ensure that the floppy is still in the floppy drive and 
      press <Enter>.

      Insert the second SLS floppy volume when prompted to do so.

   5. After several messages indicating the progress of the installation of 
      this SLS, you will see a message informing you that files are now being
      fixed by the binary fix2000(ADM) installed by SLS UOD426C.  At this 
      stage, the binary is being applied to all files and utilities that 
      are known to be broken for the operating system and any products 
      installed on your system. 

      NOTE:  Depending on the speed of the machine and how many files 
      will require correcting, this part of the installation may take 
      some time. 

   6. After the binary has found and corrected all the required files,
      a message will be displayed to say that all files corrected have 
      first been saved to a backup directory. The script will display how 
      much disk space has been taken by the backup files and you will be 
      prompted as to whether you want to archive the backup or keep the 
      backup files on the hard disk. Enter "y" if you want to archive the 
      backup files to a backup medium, or "n" if you want to keep the 
      backup directory on the system.  Refer to (2) in the Notes section 
      for more details.


The installation is now complete. Once SLS UOD426C has been installed, the 
binary supplied with SLS UOD426C, fix2000(ADM), is left on the system as 
/usr/bin/fix2000. This binary can be used to check for other applications 
whose files may require correcting. The list of known broken files and 
utilities in SCO operating systems and known affected SCO products are 
kept in the directory: 

               /usr/lib/custom/uod426/fix 

Lists are provided for SCO UNIX (uod), SCO FoxBASE+ (fox), SCO MPX (mpx),
SCO Office Portfolio (op2) and Microsoft Word for UNIX systems (wrd).
(NOTE: The file list of SCO UNIX, uod, also includes the list of affected
SCCS binaries from the development system.)

If necessary, fix2000(ADM) can be run against these lists to recheck the 
files, or to check and correct any file that has been reinstalled after SLS 
UOD426C. 

If any parts of the operating system, or one of the known affected SCO 
applications is reinstalled, it is highly recommended that fix2000(ADM) is 
run against the appropriate list(s). 

Additionally, should other SCO products, or applications and any non-SCO 
products or applications be installed either before or after SLS UOD426C, 
it is advisable to check these as well.

For further information on the binary fix2000(ADM), see the supplied manual 
page. This is available online, and a hard copy is provided in the Notes 
section below, under Note (1).



REMOVING SLS UOD426C

To remove SLS UOD426C from your system:

   1. Log in as "root" in single-user mode.
   
   2. At the shell prompt, invoke custom(ADM):

            custom

   3. Choose the option Remove, and highlight the SCO Year 2000 SLS 
      to select it. Press <Enter>.

   4. Choose the package "ALL" from the list of packages.

   5. Answer "Yes" when prompted if you want to continue with the removal.
   
   6. If you had previously archived the saved files in the backup directory
      to a backup medium and removed the backed up files from the system, you 
      will be prompted to insert the backup medium to restore the backup area.
      See note (3) in the Notes section for further details.

   7. All the original files previously saved during the installation of 
      SLS UOD426C are now restored, and the binary fix2000(ADM) and its 
      manual page is removed from the system. 

The removal is now complete. 



Notes 
=====

1. fix2000(ADM) 

Provided below is a copy of the manual page for the fix2000(ADM) binary. 
NOTE: This is not available as part of the standard SCO operating system 
environment.  fix2000(ADM) was specially produced for SLS UOD426C.



fix2000(ADM)                   15 January 1996               fix2000(ADM)

Name

        fix2000 - Check for and fix known bug which causes dates after
                  28th February, 2000 to be printed incorrectly.


Syntax

        fix2000 [ -ipv ] file ...


Description

        The command without options will scan the specified 'file'(s)
        to determine whether a known bug is present in 'file'(s) which
        causes the command to handle dates after 28th February, 2000
        incorrectly. Its exit status indicates whether or not the bug
        is present in any of the 'file'(s), and so it is generally more
        useful to run it on a single 'file' at a time.

        The following options are recognized:

        -v      Prints name of 'file'(s) which contain the bug on standard
                output.

        -p      Attempts to fix the bug where present.  This will fail
                if the 'file'(s) cannot be opened for writing.

        -i      Interactive version of '-p' above.  Will prompt for
                confirmation before attempting to fix each 'file'
                containing the bug.


Examples

        A list of all binaries in the system containing this bug can be
        printed using the following:

                find / -type f -exec fix2000 -v {} \;


Diagnostics

        Exit status is 0 if any occurrences of the bug are found, 1 if
        no occurrences of the bug are found, and 2 for usage errors or
        inaccessible files.


Notes

        The fix2000 utility knows about five different variations of
        the same bug. There may be more, in which case the command
        will need to be updated to cater for these.


2. Archiving the backup directory

The backup directory, /usr/lib/custom/uod426, is a backup of all the files 
that have been corrected by SLS UOD426C.  At the end of the installation 
procedure, you will be told how much space is taken up by the entire backup 
directory. You can choose whether or not to archive the backup directory 
to an archive medium of your choice, or whether or not to leave the backup 
directory in place. Archiving the backup directory to an archive medium 
will allow you to remove the backup directory, thus freeing up the extra 
hard disk space taken up. 

Should you choose to archive the backup directory, this can be done either 
during the installation of SLS UOD426C, or afterwards. Choosing to archive 
the backup directory after SLS UOD426C has been installed allows any further 
applications (whether SCO or non-SCO) that were not checked and corrected 
during the installation of SLS UOD426C, but which were checked and fixed 
with fix2000(ADM), to be backed up. 

If you choose to archive the backup directory during the installation of 
SLS UOD426C, you can choose to remove the backup files at the same time, or 
leave the backup directory in place. Choosing the option to remove the backup 
files at the same time as archiving them will not completely remove the entire
backup directory. You will be left with just the lists of known broken files 
and utilities. If you choose to remove the backup afterwards, the entire 
backup directory will be removed.

It is recommended that you choose to archive the backup directory during 
installation, then answer 'yes' to remove the backup files. The files that 
are left, the lists of known broken files and utilities, take up a negligible
amount of space on the hard disk and can be used by fix2000(ADM) to recheck
the corrected files.

It is also recommended that the backup directory be archived to a tape or DAT 
device, although any valid device can be specified.

Free disk space requirements for installing SLS UOD426C will depend on the 
default software installed and the total number of files requiring correction.
You should ensure you have a minimum of 28Mb free disk space for the full 
SCO UNIX and Open Desktop systems. This figure needs to be increased if you 
have additional products installed. 

3. Removing SLS UOD426C

If you remove SLS UOD426C, you must have a valid backup directory present on 
the system, or a valid archive.  SLS UOD426C will not be removed if no backup
is available.  Make sure that any archive of the backup directory taken 
is valid, can be read and is kept in a safe location. 


4. SLS UOD426C log file

A log file is created by SLS UOD426C, if this is the first installation.
The log file is found in /usr/lib/custom/uod426.log.  If SLS UOD426C 
has been installed before and is being installed again, the previous log 
file is backed up to /usr/lib/custom/uod426.log.bck.  The log file can be 
used to check the installation and removal of SLS UOD426C.  It is useful 
to see what files have been saved and modified, and to debug the 
installation or removal of SLS UOD426C should there be problems.

5. Using fix2000(ADM)

If fix2000(ADM) is to be used after SLS UOD426C has been installed to 
check files from any SCO products and/or non-SCO products, it is important 
to note that fix2000(ADM) does not automatically back up files to be 
patched. fix2000(ADM) only patches the affected files. You must ensure 
that you first back up any files to be patched before running fix2000(ADM).

You should first use fix2000(ADM) to generate a list of the files to be 
patched, then create a simple script to back up files to be patched before 
running fix2000(ADM). If you do not do this, any files that are patched by
fix2000(ADM) will not be saved and you will not be able to restore the 
original files. 

6. New /bin/date(C) and /etc/asktime(ADM)

The enhanced versions of /bin/date(C) and /etc/asktime(ADM) are provided 
as is but have been tested insofar as to ensure they work as expected.
Note: There is no new man page for either of these enhanced utilities.

On removing SLS UOD426C, both enhanced utilities are removed from the 
system and replaced by their original versions. 


7. /shlib/protlib_s

The new version of at(C) supplied by SLS UOD426C is built from a source
version that may be later than the source version from which the current 
at(C) is built from. The later version of at(C) requires a shared library 
be installed in the /shlib directory. On pre-3.2v4 based SCO systems, this 
shared library is not present.

SLS UOD426C will install the additional shared library, if needed, and 
remove it when SLS UOD426C is removed from the system. The additional 
shared library installed is:

   /shlib/protlib_s


If you have questions regarding this SLS, or the product on which it is
installed, please contact your software supplier.

We appreciate your business.
