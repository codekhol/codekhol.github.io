On rebooting SCO UNIX System V/386, the message "There may be 
a system dump memory image in the swap device" is seen and may 
be seen on subsequent reboots, indicats that a dump of system
memory may have been written to the swap device following a
system panic.  If required for debugging purposes the dump
it can be saved onto floppy or tape for analysis by the crash(ADM)
utility.  This however does not delete the dump image from 
/dev/swap.

During the boot sequence, the script "/etc/dumpsave" is run
which executes the undocumented binary /etc/memsize which can
be used to detect a saved memory image.  When a system has
sufficient memory that it does not have to use swap, a saved
memory image will never be overwritten, and so the message will
always appear on rebooting.

The program clearswap can be used to overwrite the flag that 
/etc/memsize uses to detect a dump image.

To install clearswap, copy the compressed (.Z) file into one of
your bin directories and explode it with the following command:

	uncompress clearswap.Z

You will need to make it executable, as follows:

	chmod 755 clearswap

Note that clearswap should not be run on a live swapping system,
and requires no parameters:

	clearswap
