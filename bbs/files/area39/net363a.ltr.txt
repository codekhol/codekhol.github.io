Dear SCO Customer,

Enclosed is Support Level Supplement (SLS) NET363A.  This SLS contains
several updates for SCO TCP/IP 1.2.0 binaries and kernel drivers.  A
list of what binaries and drivers are replaced is included at the end
of this cover letter.

Installation:

To install this SLS you will need to be in System Maintenance mode as this
SLS requires that the kernel be re-linked and re-booted.  To enter System 
Maintenance mode, execute the following command as root:

shutdown -y -g5 -i1 -f"System going down to install SLS NET363A"

This command will give users five minutes to clean up and logoff the system.
If more time is necessary, increase the number after the -g option.  Please 
refer to the online manual page on shutdown(ADM) for more information.

This SLS also requires that you are installing on SCO UNIX System V/386 
Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.0 or SCO Open Desktop Release 2.0 
and that SCO TCP/IP Release 1.2.0 is properly installed.  A fatal instal-
lation error will occur if this is not the case.  It will also check to 
insure that the Link kit is properly installed.  If it is not, a fatal 
error will occur.  If a Link kit failure occurs, contact SCO Technical 
Support to have a fax sent to you with information on how to correct this 
error.

Once you are in System Maintenance mode and logged in as root, insert the 
SLS floppy into the drive and type "custom".  Select the "install" prompt 
and choose the "A New Product" option.  Once custom is finished installing 
the SLS, reboot the system via the "/etc/reboot" command.  The installation
process is now complete.

Removal:

This SLS will back up all the binaries and kernel drivers into the directory
/usr/lib/custom/save/net363. Using the custom option to remove the SLS will
have no effect as this SLS is designed to be permanent.

The following instructions must be followed if you wish to remove or re-install
this SLS.

1. The following files can be found in /usr/lib/custom/save/net363:

   bootpd
   sendmail
   telnetd

   The binaries bootpd and telnetd will need to be moved to the /etc directory
   and should have the following permissions:

   -rwx--x--x   1 bin      bin        71422 Mar 12 08:20 /etc/bootpd
   -rwx--x--x   1 bin      bin        68734 Mar 23 18:05 /etc/telnetd

   The sendmail binary will need to be moved to either /usr/lib or 
   /usr/lib/sendmail.d, depending upon if you are using sendmail or
   MMDF as your mail transport agent.  If you are using sendmail it
   should have the following permissions:

   -rws--x--x   3 root     bin       143170 Mar 12 08:27 /usr/lib/sendmail

   To set the permissions correctly, use the following chmod command: 

   chmod 4711 /usr/lib/sendmail

   In addition, sendmail needs to be linked to the following files:

   ln /usr/lib/sendmail /usr/lib/newaliases
   ln /usr/lib/sendmail /usr/lib/mailq

   The following command should also be run to read and freeze your 
   sendmail.cf configuration file:

   /usr/lib/sendmail -bz

   If you are not using sendmail, then simply place the binary in 
   /usr/lib/sendmail.d.


2. The following directories can be found in /usr/lib/custom/save/net363:

   ip
   spt
   tcp

   Each of these directories contain a Driver.o; the spt directory will 
   also contain a space.c.  Move these files to /etc/conf/pack.d under 
   their respective directory names and set the permissions as follows:

-rw-r--r--   1 root     sys      7244 Mar 15 16:50 /etc/conf/pack.d/spt/Driver.o
-rw-r--r--   1 root     sys      1103 Mar 15 15:21 /etc/conf/pack.d/spt/space.c

Once these files have been replaced and the /usr/lib/custom/save/net363
directory has been removed, the SLS can be re-installed.  It should not 
be necessary to remove the SLS.  If a condition should arise that requires 
re- installation of the SLS (such as removing and re-installing the TCP/IP 
product itself), then the above steps will need to be followed.  If you are
not concerned about saving these files, then it is also possible to remove 
the /usr/lib/custom/save/net363 directory and the SLS will re-install.  If 
you remove the SLS without saving the files in /usr/lib/custom/save/net363
and it should be necessary to retrieve the original drivers or binaries, then
you will have to use the custom utility to retrieve them from the original
media.

SLS NET363A Description:

The following binaries or kernel drivers have been updated to fix the
following issues:

/etc/bootpd: The problem occurs because of an incompatibility between bootp 
and tftpd when tftpd is operated in secure mode.

A client requesting a bootfile sends a BOOTREQUEST asking for the file
/tftpboot/bootfile (for example).  The bootpd on the host processes this,
tests for existence of the file and sends a reply containing the validated
path /tftpboot/bootfile.  A tftp request is then sent to get the required file.
           
For example, if tftpd on the host has been invoked by "tftpd -s tftpboot",
then when the request is received, the secure directory path will be appended 
to the beginning of the pathname in the download request, generating
/tftpboot/tftpboot/bootfile which does not exist. 

/etc/telnetd: On machines running SCO MPX Release 2.0, when running under heavy
load, telnetd would core dump.

/usr/lib/sendmail: If the nameserver is not running, then sendmail is unable 
to fully canonnicalize a hostname via the /etc/hosts file.

A user attempts to send mail to someone on a different domain. They specify
user@machine, assuming that sendmail will canonnicalize the machinename.
If the nameserver is not running, the name will never be canonnicalized.  
This means the domain name will never be appended to the mail address in the
form user@machine.domain.

/etc/conf/pack.d/ip/Driver.o: If a SLIP or PPP line had been configured in
conjunction with one or more ethernet cards (or other SLIP or PPP devices) 
it was not possible to correctly route packets between the devices or lines.
When trying to add routes to the devices, the route command would return
"Network Unreachable" even though all the configuration files were correct.
Customers running MorningStar PPP typically experienced this issue.  This was
a problem in the routing algorithm in the ip device driver and has been
corrected.

/etc/conf/pack.d/spt/Driver.o  and  /etc/conf/pack.d/spt/space.c: When trying
to use the remote login utilities (telnet or rlogin), typically after 30 or 
more users have successfully logged in to the system, the remote login utili-
ties will hang and the system must be rebooted to allow any other users to 
remotely log in.

When using the cut and paste utility in xclients, if the xclients are using the
remote login utilities, the cut and paste operation would hang.

When using the telnet utility, a buffer overflow would occur if more than 254
characters were typed on one line without a newline.

/etc/conf/pack.d/tcp/Driver.o: When running the Cognos X application, a DOS
xclient may hang on machines running HP ARPA TCP/IP.  The hang was caused by 
a timing issue when the Cognos xclient would close and then try to immediately
reopen the socket port.

Multiple invocations of "rcmd" when trying to start up xclients (or other jobs)
from one or more machines would hang after the 3rd or 4th xclient (or job) had
started.  This behavior was typically seen on DOS clients, while UNIX clients
do not typically demonstrate this behavior

Multiple invocations of "rcmd" or "rcp" would cause the first attempt to
succeed immediately, and each one after would be delayed by six seconds.
        
If a <SYN> was received on a connected peer, then the receiver would send two
<RST>'s.
