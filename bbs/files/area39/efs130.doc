Dear Customer,

The enclosed IBM Compatibility EFS (Extended Functionality Supplement)
contains a new /boot program and is intended for use with the SCO UNIX 
System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.0, 4.1 and SCO Open 
Desktop Version 2.0.

This EFS is required to install SCO Unix and Open Desktop on the 
following IBM hardware as it supplies a new boot program which allows 
the hard disk to be recognised.

PS/2 Model 56 SLC, 57 SLC (8556, 9556, 8557, 9557)
PS/2 Model 76, 77 (9576, 9577)
PS/2 Model 85 (9585)
PS/ValuePoint 6384 Model 325T, 425SX, 433DX (Model C, F, M)
ThinkPad 700 and 700C portables

Please read the entire letter before beginning the installation of this EFS 
to insure proper configuration of your system.

This EFS is supplied in the form of a bootable, custom-installable diskette
i.e the diskette is used to boot the system and is then custom installed to
get the new boot program installed on the hard disk. 

The new boot supplied with this EFS correctly identifies the on-board SCSI
on the above PS/2 machines.  It also recognizes the IDE disk on the ValuePoint 
6384 series of AT-bus machines, and the disk on the ThinkPad portable.

To fully install this EFS, you need to:

    1.  Boot from the EFS (instructions in section I. below)
    2.  Custom install the EFS (instructions in sections II or III)


I.  BOOTING 


Use the following procedure to initially boot SCO Unix System V/386 or 
Open Desktop using the EFS:

1.  Insert the diskette labeled 'IBM Compatibility EFS for Unix/Open
    Desktop' in the floppy drive.

2.  Manually reset the system or turn the power on.

3.  When the boot prompt is displayed:

        Boot
        :

    remove the EFS and insert the N1 diskette into the floppy drive.


4.  Press <Return>, to continue the installation as instructed in the 
    Installation Guide and follow the instructions below for installing 
    the EFS on a Unix or Open Desktop system.


II. INSTALLATION UNDER UNIX VERSION 4.0

1.  Once the minimum Unix Runtime System is installed, you will be prompted
    to:

        1.  Install additional software (Extended Utilities or applications)
        2.  Proceed with system configuration


    IMPORTANT: You MUST choose option 1, "Install additional software"

   The installation program custom(ADM) is then invoked and will allow you
   to carry on with the installation.

   - If you wish to install :

                . the Extended Utilities, do so now as documented in the 
                  Installation Guide.  

                . Maintenance Supplement Version 4.1, do so now as documented
                  in the Maintenance Supplement letter.  (See note below on
                  the Unix Maintenance Supplement for more information).

    The EFS should be installed last as it provides a new boot program which 
    must be installed on the hard disk for the system to work correctly.

   - When ready to install the EFS, position the cursor so that 'Install' is 
     highlighted and press <Enter>.

   - Make sure that the words 'A New Product' are highlighted in the window
     found in the lower right hand corner of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - Make sure the words 'Entire Product' are highlighted in the 'Choose an
     option' section of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - You will be prompted to 'Insert distribution Volume 1 and press <Return>'.
     Insert the diskette labeled 'IBM Compatibility EFS for Unix/Open Desktop'
     and press <Enter>.

   - You will see the following messages:

       Installing custom data files
       Executing Product Prep Script

       Saving file /boot into 
           /usr/lib/custom/save/boot.ibm

   - At the bottom of the screen, you will be prompted to 'Press any key to
     continue'.  Press <Enter>

   - The message 'Creating file lists' will flash on the screen.  You will
     be prompted to 'Insert the requested Volume and press <Return>'.  The
     diskette is already in the drive, therefore press <Enter>

   - You will see the following message:

       Extracting Files

   - After the EFS has been installed, you can continue with normal OS
     installation.

2.  Continue with the rest of the normal operating system installation
    process as described in the Installation Guide.


Note on the Unix Maintenance Supplement:

If you plan on installing the Unix Maintenance Supplement, MSv4.1, you 
must remember to install the IBM Compatibility EFS _after_ the Maintenance 
Supplement.  If you install a Maintenance Supplement and reboot without 
installing the EFS,  you should follow the procedure outlined below
in section III (Installation Under Open Desktop) to reboot the machine and
install the EFS. (The Unix Maintenance Supplement also contains a new boot
program but without the support provided by the IBM Compatibility EFS.)

If you install Unix Version 4.0 using the EFS and at a later date wish to
install MSv4.1,  you must remember to re-install the EFS after you install
MSv4.1. (Note: when /etc/custom prompts for the package to install,  you
should choose "IBM Compatibility EFS for Unix/Open Desktop" as opposed to
"A New Product".)


III.  INSTALLATION UNDER OPEN DESKTOP

As there is no stage during Open Desktop installation where the user can install
additional software,  you must carry out the following steps to ensure that
the EFS is loaded onto the hard disk:

1.  Upon completion of the Open Desktop installation, you are prompted to 
    reboot the machine.  At this stage, re-insert the EFS into the floppy 
    drive and reboot.

2.  At the boot prompt, type the following command:

        hd(40)unix

3.  When the system boots up,  go into System Maintenance Mode, invoke the 
    command "/etc/custom" and carry out the following steps:


   - Position the cursor so that 'Install' is highlighted and
     press <Enter>.

   - Make sure that the words 'A New Product' are highlighted in the window
     found in the lower right hand corner of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - Make sure the words 'Entire Product' are highlighted in the 'Choose an
     option' section of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - You will be prompted to 'Insert the requested volume and press <Return>'.
     If you have removed the EFS from the floppy drive, you should re-insert it
     and press <Enter>.

   - You will see the following messages:

       Installing custom data files
       Executing Product Prep Script

       Saving file /boot into 
               /usr/lib/custom/save/boot.ibm

   - At the bottom of the screen, you will be prompted to 'Press any key to
     continue'.  Press <Enter>

   - The message 'Creating file lists' will flash on the screen.  You will
     be prompted to 'Insert the requested Volume and press <Return>'.  The
     diskette is already in the drive, therefore press <Enter>

   - You will see the following message:

       Extracting Files

4.  When complete, exit custom and remove the EFS diskette from the floppy 
    drive.

5.  Reboot the system.

The system is now installed properly and ready for use.

If you have any further questions, please contact your supplier.

Yours sincerely,
