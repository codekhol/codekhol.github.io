        <h1>welcome to my `pintel x86` meuseum</h1>
        <p>yeah, my pinned intel x86 processor collection. that's where the name comes from. most of them are new and never installed, others are in excellent condition after these many years.</p>
        <div class="meuseum">
            <ul>
                <h2>8086</h2>
                first in the family.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>8088</h2>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>80186</h2>
                <p>these were not much used in ibm compatible pcs.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>80188</h2>
                <p>a different variation of 80186.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>80286</h2>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>80386</h2>
                <p>12 mhz 386? no way! that's too expensive. but if you offer, i will gladly accept.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>rapidcad</h2>
                <p>these are pretty rare, had to empty my pocket to adopt the twins.</p>
            </ul>   
            <ul>
                <h2>80486</h2>             
                <p>see! this one has a black cap.</p>
                <p>nice blues <3</p>
                <p>this is factory remarked</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>pentium</h2>
                <p>this one is really cool, original pentium. i want another one (sx754) that is the 66 mhz version, that's much more rarer</p>
                <p>my favourite series, high school nostalgia <3</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>pentium pro</h2>
                <p>you know what? these have the highest gold content. they are the best target for gold scrappers </p>
                
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>pentium ii</h2>
                <p>mighty beats!</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>pentium iii</h2>
                <p>see the difference, the right one is tualatin, i just like the name</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>pentium 4</h2>
                <p>and almost the end of my meuseum, where processors are pinless (for painless shipping).</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h2>but wait! before you exit you must see 'the kings on the throne'</h2>
                <p>these 2 were pulled from my very own desktop pcs from good old days. no need to mention my recent crap laptops that have left nothing but anger. i learned a lot of cad and programming using these 2 and i owe them much. i was just self-taught and i am proud of it.</p>
