 ## ABOUT
I am an experienced software developer with over 12 years of employment record. I am a proficient coder in several programming languages encompassing the entire stack from writing robust and efficient back-end code to implementing clear and consistent front-end.
Clean code, consistency, automation, ... 
not afraid of asking questions, even if im the only one in a group who doesn't understand something\
i cant read clever code, but i can understand clear code\
i cant read files with 1000 LoC, but i can read small files\
i don't write comments unless absolutely necessary (i document public interfaces, i rarely document internal details)\
i use paper and whiteboard to discuss ideas visually along being verbally\
im argumetative, i refuse some principles in software development, there's no silver bullet in our industry, principles change rapidly\
using code generation and automation, i prefer consistency over creativity\
i feel more productive when removing code than when adding code\
i dont feel comfortable when pairing, i cant write clean code the first time, i re-iterate and re-wrrite multiple times\
there are [rare] cases that 'goto' statemet is the best option to use\
design patterns are all summarised into one principle, use interfaces\


facts i love to follow\
think about data structures not algorithms\
unix philosophy\
solid, kiss, dry
