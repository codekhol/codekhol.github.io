    size="2">RAID was originally an acronym for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks. Each
    RAID level describes the method in which data is distributed across a number of disk
    drives, known as an array. It must be noted however, that these are not true
    &quot;levels&quot;, as the higher levels don't contain all the functions of the lower
    levels, and RAID 5 is not necessarily better than RAID 3. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The birth of drive arrays effectively started with a paper published by
    Berkeley University (CA), this paper classified the different architectures as RAID
    levels. The driving force was to provide minicomputers with high performance drive
    subsystems using the (then) newly available low cost 5.25&quot; Winchesters rather than
    the very expensive mass storage magnetic drives used by mainframes. The concept was to
    provide the required capacity using multiple 5.25&quot; drives connected as an array; in
    effect the drives were operated in parallel to increase their performance. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The word 'Inexpensive' in RAID's original definition is now somewhat of
    a misnomer. The drives used in a RAID solution tend to be high quality, fast, SCSI devices
    which are by no means the cheapest drives available for PCs. Consequently, the definition
    of RAID is undergoing a change from Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks to Redundant
    Array of Independent Disks. </font><menu>

    <p><a name="raid_1"></a><font size="3"><strong>RAID Levels</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The original Berkeley paper described five RAID levels. Of these only
    RAID 1, 3 and 5 are now considered practical solutions. RAID 2 and 4 have been superseded
    by RAID 3 and 5 respectively as they offer similar or superior performance at no
    additional cost. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">There are other levels of RAID, but of these, only RAID 0 is accepted as
    an industry standard. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Note: For the purpose of this document, the diagrams illustrate a RAID
    solution using either two or four disk drives - this is not a mandatory requirement. Each
    RAID solution should be tailored to the customer's application using the appropriate
    number of drives. </font></p>
    <p><strong><font size="2">RAID LEVEL 0 </font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="2">RAID 0 was not described by the Berkeley team but due to its wide
    availability has since been endorsed by the RAID Advisory Board (RAB). RAB is an
    association of suppliers and consumers of RAID related products and other organisations
    with an interest in RAID technology set up to standardise RAID related terminology
    throughout the industry. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2"><img SRC="graphics/raid00.gif" BORDER="0" width="310"
    height="209"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">RAID 0, also known as disk striping, works by segmenting a user file
    into 'data blocks' and then writing the blocks sequentially across the drives in the
    array. Disk striping offers excellent performance by transferring data using several disks
    at once. However, in this configuration only one copy of the data is stored, and therefore
    no fault tolerance is achieved. In fact this method is even more open to data loss; when
    four drives make up a single logical drive, that logical drive is four times more likely
    to fail than a single physical disk. Strictly speaking RAID level 0 is not a RAID at all
    as there is no redundancy. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">RAID 0 can be implemented on any NetWare or Windows NT system with more
    than 1 hard disk, without the introduction of any special hardware. Under NetWare this
    option is called &#147;Spanning a volume&#148; and is achieved when creating a new volume
    either at installation time or when adding another drive. Under Windows NT 3.5 this is a
    standard feature of the Disk Administrator and is called &#147;Create Stripe Set&#148;.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><font size="2">RAID LEVEL 1 </font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="2">RAID 1 is also known as mirroring or shadowing. In its simplest form two
    disks are connected to a single controller, and as data is written to one disk the same
    information is also written to the mirrored disk. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2"><img SRC="graphics/raid01.gif" BORDER="0" width="310"
    height="190"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If one drive fails, the system continues to run using data from the
    remaining drive. However, if the controller fails, both drives fail and the system is
    down. To overcome this, two controller cards can be used, which is a method known as
    duplexing. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The biggest disadvantage of mirroring is its cost. With each active
    drive duplicated exactly, there is 50 percent data redundancy and twice the cost of the
    same system with no mirroring. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Again, RAID 1 can be implemented on any NetWare or Windows NT system
    with more than 1 hard disk, without the introduction of any special hardware.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><font size="2">RAID LEVEL 3 </font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="2">RAID 3 employs a technique called 'disk striping with redundancy'. This
    offers the advantage of disk striping but without the very high level of data redundancy
    and cost of mirroring.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2"><img SRC="graphics/raid03.gif" BORDER="0" width="310"
    height="221"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">It provides data redundancy by producing 'parity' data that is stored on
    a dedicated drive referred to as the parity drive. Parity data is created by applying
    complex mathematical calculations to the original data which extract relevant bits of
    information that can be stored using a fraction of the space used by a mirror image. In
    the event of a drive failure, this parity information can be used to reconstruct the
    original data. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The disadvantage with this technique is that every time a write occurs,
    parity information must be stored to a single disk. The idea of introducing
    &#147;Striping&#148; is so that when a system is under heavy load, the writes are spread
    across a number of drives in parallel, implementing RAID 3 therefore reduces the
    performance of the system by having only a single drive for parity.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>RAID LEVEL 5</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">RAID 5 combines data striping and the storing of parity data on all
    drives, as opposed to one dedicated parity drive. This option requires a minimum of three
    hard disk drives. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2"><img SRC="graphics/raid05.gif" BORDER="0" width="310"
    height="208"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">RAID 5 and RAID 3 are very similar in terms of the benefits they offer,
    their cost implications and the way in which they function. However, there are some
    fundamental differences that make them suitable for very different applications. The
    process of storing parity data across a number of drives, rather than one dedicated parity
    drive, alleviates the bottleneck created by many parity write requests being directed to
    one drive. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In a RAID 5 configuration the amount of data actually stored on each
    individual drive during the data striping process is larger than in RAID 3. Consequently
    requests are typically serviced from one drive, as opposed to several drives, and thus the
    potential competition for access to one drive is minimised. Due to this process RAID 5 is
    particularly effective for applications which access a high number of small files such as
    large databases and transaction processing systems (which most network users will be
    running). In contrast, RAID 3 is particularly effective for applications such as image
    processing which access large files. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>OTHER RAID LEVELS</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Many RAID products available today use RAID levels other than the
    standard ones in their names or descriptions, e.g. RAID 6, RAID 8 etc. Usually these are a
    combination of the levels described above, or the subsystem that implements one of these
    may have been enhanced with a feature such as a cache. Of these non-standard levels, RAID
    6 and RAID 10 are more widely used than any others. </font></p>
    <p><strong><font size="2">RAID LEVEL 6 </font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="2">RAID 6 is very similar to RAID 5, except that it stores two copies of
    the parity data rather than one, with each copy being written to a separate drive. This
    feature significantly improves reliability as three disks in the array must fail for data
    to be lost; however, the write performance is the lowest of all RAIDs. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>RAID LEVEL 10 (1/0)</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Level 10, usually pronounced &quot;one zero&quot;, combines the features
    of RAID level 0 (striping) and RAID level 1 (mirroring) to produce a system with very high
    performance and high data reliability, but at a relatively high cost. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2"><img SRC="graphics/raid10.gif" BORDER="0" width="300"
    height="219"> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">It should be noted that some manufacturers use the term RAID 6 to define
    the combination of RAID 0 &amp; 1.</font></p>

    <p><a name="raid_2"></a><strong><font size="3">The Apricot Implementation</font><font
    size="2"> </font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="2">Apricot have introduced this feature into the standard FT//ex 1000,
    renaming it the FT//ex 1000R. This system employs a very high performance RAID controller
    from a company called DPT which initially provides a high speed 32 bit PCI local bus
    adapter with a single channel, 10MB/s SCSI controller and 4Mb of high speed cache. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>CHANGES TO THE FT//ex 1000</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The SCSI cable is replaced by a PCB backplane that allows up to 3 SCSI
    channels to be fed to the 8 drive bays in the FT//ex. This board provides both a path for
    the SCSI, the connectors to &#147;hot swap&#148; SCSI devices and switchable terminators
    that allow a flexible combination of either 1, 2 or 3 channel SCSI. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Each of the eight drive trays have extra fittings applied that allow the
    drive tray to be locked in place and the drive to be powered down to initiate a &#147;hot
    swap&#148; of a faulty drive. In addition an LED shows when the drive is correctly
    powered. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The on-board Adaptec AIC7870 SCSI controller is employed to control the
    CD ROM drive and any tape devices fitted in the system while the DPT RAID controller
    handles the hard disk drives. We would always recommend this configuration as the handling
    of removable media devices on a RAID controller over-complicates the configuration whilst
    not providing any advantages over using the on-board controller. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Apricot sell systems with 4, 1Gb IBM &#147;Pegasus&#148; drives
    installed. This is what is considered the optimum configuration for RAID 5 as it allows
    the use of 3 of the hard disks to be employed as a RAID 5 system and the fourth drive to
    be as a &#147;hot standby&#148; drive. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>HOT SWAP</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Hot Swap is not a facility offered by RAID but is dependant upon the
    server itself. It requires the ability to power down each hard disk drive independently
    without shutting down the server. Once the drive is powered down then the drive can be
    removed without putting too much electrical interference on the, still active, SCSI bus. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">On the FT//ex 1000R this is achieved by replacement drive trays that
    include both a power switch for each drive and a PCB edge connector with staggered
    power/ground/data lines that connect smoothly into the Backplane. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>HOT STANDBY</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This is a facility provided by the RAID controller card. If an
    additional disk is placed on the SCSI bus but is not used for any data, then in the event
    of one of the other drives failing, the data and parity information is recreated onto the
    &#147;spare&#148; drive thus allowing for more than one drive to fail without data loss. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>THE DPT PM3224 SmartRAID CONTROLLER</strong> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This is a full length, 32 bit PCI 2.0 local bus card containing a 68030
    40MHz processor to give full 132MByte/s PCI bus mastering. It supports full SCSI-2
    initially on a single channel with the option to upgrade to 2 or even 3 channels. The DPT
    card will support RAID levels 0, 1 and 5 (not RAID 3). </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Cache starts with a single 4MB SIMM and is upgradeable to a full 64MB
    via 72 pin, 36 bit SIMMs with ECC parity. The board has 4 SIMM sockets which will accept
    either 4MB or 16MB each, allowing a wide range of upgrade options without wasting SIMMs
    that you have already purchased. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The card also includes on-board sensors for temperature and voltage
    fluctuations and is upgradeable to wide SCSI-2. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Shipped with the card are drivers for NetWare 3.x, 4.x, IBM OS/2, SCO
    UNIX, Microsoft OS/2 1.x, Windows NT, Banyan VINES, UnixWare and many more. With some of
    these environments it is possible to make changes to the system from a remote site using
    DPT's Storage Manager software. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In the event of a disk failure, it is possible to both log any events as
    well as broadcast a message to all users or selected groups informing them of any fault in
    the system, whilst the server continues to run unaffected. Connections can also be made
    via modem and notifications can be passed via pager or fax.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2">With RAID hardware and software installed, it is possible to continue
    normal operation in the event of a disk failure and with Apricot&#146;s FT//ex 1000R it is
    possible to rectify faults without downing the server. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">However, in any RAID scenario, whilst the system is running in
    &#147;degraded&#148; mode (ie. one of the disks has failed and it has not yet updated any
    hot spare drives that may be available) switching off the wrong drive can cause data loss.

    <p><font size="2">It is vital that all hardware engineers who may need to change drives in
    a RAID system have training on what effects removing the wrong drive can have. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Apricot will run a number of seminars explaining RAID further and
    helping you to recommend just how many drives and in what configuration they are best
    installed.</font></p>

      <dt><font size="2">What does RAID stand for?</font></dt>
      <dd><font size="2">RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, or more recently
        Redundant Array of Independent Disks </font></dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><font size="2">Why is RAID beneficial?</font></dt>
      <dd><font size="2">It can provide an increased degree of fault tolerance to prevent loss of
        information in the event of a failure of the storage sub-system. </font></dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><font size="2">Are there different types of RAID implementation?</font></dt>
      <dd><font size="2">There are 6 main types of RAID, known as levels 0 to 5, although in
        practice only levels 0, 1, 3, and 5 are used. </font></dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><font size="2">Is one particular type of RAID best?</font></dt>
      <dd><font size="2">The simple answer is 'no'. The most suitable implementation depends on
        the type of data that is likely to be processed. </font></dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><font size="2">Which RAID implementation is best for each type of data?</font></dt>
      <dd><font size="2">In general RAID 0 is used where speed is the only consideration as no
        redundancy is provided. RAID 1 is excellent where the need for reliability and speed are
        paramount; however, the cost of data storage cannot be a consideration since the amount of
        disk space is doubled. RAID 5 is best where there are small files with a lot of disk I/O
        such as large databases or transaction processing systems. </font></dd>
