        bus to generate the burst has an associated delay. Far simpler is to increment an internal
        memory counter once the first address has been issued. Burst EDO does just this. Most
        burst EDO promise a page cycle time of 15ns (a 66MHz page frequency). This is the magic
        figure as it corresponds to zero wait state performance for Pentium class systems. Burst
        EDO is being positioned as a cheaper alternative to other more radical DRAM architecture's

<dd><font size="2">Extended Data Out (EDO) DRAM improves on the access speeds of FPM (Fast
        Page Mode) devices. The column address control pin of FPM DRAM is de-asserted prior to
        each issued column address, clearing the output data bus (placing it in high impedance).
        This imposes a setup and hold time in which the output data must be read before
        deactivating the control pin. EDO overcomes this by latching the output data, enabling the
        read to take place after the column control pin is deasserted, speeding up the overall
        process.<br>
        EDO shares a common manufacturing procedure with FPM, offering enhanced performance at a
        minimal additional cost. EDO is expected to supersede FPM DRAM. For a 50ns read access
        time, EDO has a typical page cycle time of 20ns, equivalent to a page frequency of up to

<dt><strong><font size="2">Fast Page Mode DRAM</font></strong></dt>
<dd><font size="2">DRAM consists of an array of cells, each comprising a transistor
        capacitor pair. To read or write data, DRAM is addressed first with a row and then a
        column address. Performing a read drains the cell content, however. This requires that on
        completion, time is spent writing the data back to the cell. In turn, the bit lines
        through which data is read need to be pre charged before a subsequent access can occur.
        The most prevalent DRAM type is fast page mode (FPM). FPM improves data access by passing
        the entire row (page) data to the sense amplifiers following the row address. Data in the
        page is then selected by strobing in the column addresses. A further performance benefit
        is that the write back of data and precharging is delayed until a new row address is
        issued. Typical page access speeds for FPM DRAM are 30ns for 50ns read access time device.
        This corresponds to page frequencies of up to 33MHz. FPM DRAM, at 4 and 16Mbit, is used as
        PC main memory store. However, FPM is increasingly failing to satisfy system requirements.

        Component (MIC). Options for QFP (Quad Flat Pack) or BGA (BallGrid Array) packaging are
        available on the PCI Bridge and the DP. BGA permits OEMs and motherboard manufacturers to
        use less space in their design and offer greater manufacturing robustness. The 450's high

        the Pentium Pro processor data bus out to memory and parity protection on the Pentium Pro
        processor address and control bus and all PCI signals. In addition, single-bit error
        correction is provided thereby avoiding downtime due to this error. Scalability is ensured

        device. The specification also defines the wavelength of the transceiver. The physical
        link layer is based on the common asynchronous serial port, with a few adaptations. The
        serial port is set to &quot;8N1&quot;, i.e. one start bit, eight data bits, no parity, and
        one stop bit. The infrared transmitter is off during the idle/&quot;space&quot;/1 state
        and -- in a deviation from wired serial signalling -- on only 3/16 of the
        active/&quot;mark&quot;/0 bit period. This reduced &quot;on&quot; period drops the power
        needed to transmit and moves the emitted spectrum toward a higher frequency where it is
        easier to separate from other IR sources.<br>
        Note that while serial ports are capable of full-duplex communication, the IrDA interface
        is limited to half-duplex operation due to interference from the reflected transmit
        signal. </font></dd>

        performance. SDRAM latches some or all of the address, data and control signals within the
        memory device, thereby freeing the microprocessor from having to retain signal information
        during interaction between the two. SDRAM variants include pipelined and multi bank.
        Pipelined DRAMs decouple some of the internal stages, column address devode, pre
        amplification, and I/O drive operations, for example. De coupling the operations allows
        several accesses at different stages of completion to take place. Multi bank SDRAMs use
        multiple internal memory banks, enabling refreshing and precharging to occur during a
        separate bank access. SDRAMs offer cycle times of 10ns (100MHz). This is beyond the
        performance of Burst EDO. SDRAMs are being used in graphics systems. It is also being
        targeted as the main memory for high end computer system, and for set-top box
        applications. SDRAMs are relatively expensive due to the silicon overhead of the
        additional control circuitry. Typical configurations for SDRAM are 16Mbit with 4M x 4, 2M
        x 8, and 1M x 16 data bus widths. </font></dd>

<dt><strong><font size="2">Synchronous SRAM</font></strong></dt>
<dd><font size="2">Synchronous SRAM (SSRAM) is mostly used as level two cache for 486,
        Pentium and PowerPC. As with SDRAMs, being self-timed, the devices increase overall system
        performance. For level two cache, SSRAM operate in a burst mode, with data accesses
        overlapped internally for burst fills. Here the most popular parts are the 1Mbit (32k x 32
        and 32k x 36) with 2M and 4M versions to come. Burst mode SRAM are further divided into
        pipelined and (non-pipelined) 'flow through' versions. Flow through does not have an
        output register while the pipeline variant does. Highest performance SSRAMs are pipelined.
        SRAM bandwidth performance is from 66MHz upwards. </font></dd>
