        has now been resolved.<br>
        <br>
        IPR1242 FDU or HDU failures occurred if power management was enabled. This was caused by
        the SMI handler corrupting MS-DOS memory regions and has now been resolved.<br>
        <br>
        The BIOS signed on as &#145;Xen PC&#146;. This has been changed to &#145;Apricot
        BIOS&#146;.<br>
        <br>
        &#145;SETUP&#146; has been modified to handle our power management implementation.<br>
        <br>
        If CMOS was cleared, &#145;SETUP&#146; would be entered on every boot, reporting a

        HDU power-down did not work. This has now been implemented.<br>
        <br>
        The SMI handler was not installed if SMI was disabled. This would cause the
        &#145;Standby&#146; switch and power management support to not function at all. This has
        now been resolved.<br>
        <br>
        The SMI handler was powering down the CPU after a period of inactivity, even if SMI was
        disabled. Also, if monitor power management was disabled, the monitor would not be turned
        off when the &#145;Standby&#146; switch was pressed. These problems have now been

        caused by the parity option being removed from 'SETUP' and hence leaving the CMOS location
        undefined, but code remained to actually read this location. This has now been fixed.<br>
        <br>
        The base address of the NS306 device has changed from 0x398H to 0x02EH. <br>
        <br>
        This has been addressed by BIOS code changes.<br>
        <br>
        A potential problem could occur if an SMI happened when reading or writing CMOS - the
        address offset into CMOS could be lost. This has been resolved.<br>

        The CPU was not being slowed down when the inactivity timer expired or the 'standby'

        Potentially, an application or operating system could be 'aware' of the Triton chipset and
        subsequently alter the SMI handler. The SMM RAM is now totally 'locked' to prevent this
        happening.<br>
        <br>
        The BIOS internal functions 'smi_setInactivity' and 'smi_getInactivity' would hang the
        machine. This was caused by a coding problem and has been fixed.<br>

        The BIOS internal function 'smi_SlowCPU' was not slowing down the CPU. This has been
        resolved.<br>
        <br>
        A previous code change resulted in the wrong GPIO bit being set for 3-mode floppy support.
        This has now been fixed.<br>
        <br>
        The 'Prefetch' and 'Posting' enable bits for the secondary IDE interface are now cleared,
        as these features are not supported by ATAPI devices. <br>
        <br>
        This may fix IPR1350 - 'Hard drive disappears on warm boot', but has not been tested.<br>

        Diamond BIOS V5.07.01 includes all the mods since V5.05 which were turned off for V5.06 of

          <br>
          PCI IDE Bus mastering support for Win95 added (driver required to enable this)<br>
          <br>
          Ability to free up IRQ&#146;s 6,14 and 15 by being able to disable the floppy, primary IDE
          and secondary IDE controllers from setup.<br>
          <br>
          Fix for PCI Video cards that require extra IO (e.g. ATI card)<br>
          <br>
          Various NCR (AT &amp; T) specific fixes that only come into effect when their
          `personality&#146; card is installed.<br>
          <br>
          The CMOS must be cleared when upgrading to this BIOS - due to the extra option in the
          setup the floppy /IDE controllers MAY be disabled - clearing CMOS will eliminate this
          potential problem.</font></p>

        causes the machine to hang after the memory test with a port 80 code 0f 75h.<br>
        Cause : The stealth card does not seem to be PCI 2.01 complient and is causing a phantom
        PCI device to appear which contains rubbish and has a BARD containing all F's hence the
        FMD can't accomodate the required space.<br>
        Cure : Only scan physically present slots and PCI devices.<br>
        <br>
        Problem : The Matrox Millenium card causes the machine to hang after the memory test with
        a port code of 075h<br>
        Cause : The PCIVideo routine builds a prefetchable BARD list but does not pre-configure
        the prefetchable address space, hence when the remaining PCI space is configured it
        expects to find the space allocated in the FMD list but doesn't and hangs.<br>
        Cure : As the Diamond chipset does not seem to support the prefetch capability we can
        ignore this and use the GEN_MEM_BARD_LIST which the PCIVideo does configure.<br>
        <br>
        NOTE : Also, Mod 370 saves the context of di as it gets corrupted throughout PCI
        configuration, there was one invocation that had been missed. This has been corrected in
        this mod.<br>
        <br>
        Problem : Intel 100MB/s PCI Ethernet Card did not function correctly<br>
        Cause : Memory space was being disabled <br>
        Cure : Fix from IBM preserved the memory space setting in the command register<br>
        <br>
        Note : This fix is on a switch called PCIETHERCARDFIX which is set to TRUE in
        PCI_POST.ASM.</font></td>

        causes the machine to hang after the memory test with a port 80 code 0f 75h.<br>
        Cause : The stealth card does not seem to be PCI 2.01 complient and is causing a phantom
        PCI device to appear which contains rubbish and has a BARD containing all F's hence the
        FMD can't accomodate the required space.<br>
        Cure : Only scan physically present slots and PCI devices.<br>
        <br>
        Problem : The Matrox Millenium card causes the machine to hang after the memory test with
        a port code of 075h <br>
        Cause : The PCIVideo routine builds a prefetchable BARD list but does not pre-configure
        the prefetchable address space, hence when the remaining PCI space is configured it
        expects to find the space allocated in the FMD list but doesn't and hangs.<br>
        Cure : As the Diamond chipset does not seem to support the prefetch capability we can
        ignore this and use the GEN_MEM_BARD_LIST which the PCIVideo does configure.<br>
        <br>
        NOTE : Also, Mod 370 saves the context of di as it gets corrupted throughout PCI
        configuration, there was one invocation that had been missed. This has been corrected in
        this mod.<br>
        <br>
        Problem : Intel 100MB/s PCI Ethernet Card did not function correctly<br>
        Cause : Memory space was being disabled<br>
        Cure : Fix from IBM preserved the memory space setting in the command register <br>
        <br>
        Note : This fix is on a switch called PCIETHERCARDFIX which is set to TRUE in
        PCI_POST.ASM.</font></td>

        The GEM line parallel port &#145;Genius&#146; LAN adapter would occasionally fail to
        connect to the network. This was caused by a coding error in modifications applied for the
        RTC &#145;century roll-over&#146; issue and has now been resolved.</font></td>

        Booting with Diva card, BIOS revision 5.08.05 and later with 5434 video binary caused a
        security card change error and the Diva card would request the SIN number of the
        non-existent &#145;old&#146; card. This was caused by the compresssed video binary
