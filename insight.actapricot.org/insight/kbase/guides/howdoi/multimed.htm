    Instruments</strong></font><p><font size="2"><strong>What is MIDI?</strong><br>
    All Apricot PCs supplied with audio capability also include a MIDI / Games Controller
    Port. MIDI is an acronym for Musical Instrument Digital Interface and is a communications
    protocol or common language which allows electronic musical instruments to communicate
    with each other and with computers. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">MIDI files contain the equivalent of an electronic musical score. This
    digital sheet music contains performance information, without any actual samples or
    sounds. Your computer or electronic instrument contains the patches or sampled sounds that
    are played from the MIDI score. Computer software such as Audition, Cakewalk, Midisoft,
    etc. allows computer users to either compose music on screen, or record a performance from
    an electronic instrument connected to the computer's MIDI interface port. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">MIDI computer files differ from other sound formats in that they contain
    no actual sound samples. Microsoft .WAV files, for example, contain digitised audio
    samples and as such tend to be much larger than an equivalent MIDI file. It should be
    remembered though that the same MIDI file played on two different music keyboards could
    produce different sounding results as reproduction is controlled by the musical
    instrument's sound generating capabilities. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For more information about the origins and uses of MIDI, try these WWW
    sites. </font></p>

    <p><font size="2"><strong>MIDI Interface (IN, OUT and THRU) </strong><br>
    To connect your instrument to a computer or another instrument, it must have a MIDI
    interface. Externally this appears as up to three round 5-pin port sockets labeled IN,OUT
    and THRU. These ports control all of the information routing in the MIDI system. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The IN port accepts MIDI data coming &quot;in&quot; to the unit from
    external sources. This is the data that controls the sound generators of the synthesizer. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The OUT port sends MIDI data &quot;out&quot; to the rest of the MIDI
    setup. This data results from activities of the synthesizer, such as key presses, etc. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The THRU port also sends data out to the MIDI system, but not in the
    same manner as the OUT port. The data coming from the THRU port is an exact copy of the
    data received at the synthesizer's IN port. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>How Do I Connect Electronic Musical Instruments?</strong><br>
    Lets take a simple example of connecting a MIDI keyboard to a PC. There are two basic
    types of MIDI music keyboard, a dumb keyboard and a synthesizer. A dumb keyboard (there
    may be other industry terms to describe this type of keyboard, but we're using
    &quot;dumb&quot; to highlight the differences with synthesizers) has no internal sound
    generation circuitry and relies on external equipment (PCs or other keyboards) to produce
    its sounds. Dumb keyboards generally only have a MIDI OUT port. A synthesizer, on the
    other hand, is an instrument in its own right, capable of generating its own sounds and
    normally would have IN, OUT and THRU ports. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">On the back of the PC, normally close to all the other audio connection
    ports, is the MIDI / Games controller port. This port connector is a 15-pin &quot;D&quot;
    type connector and looks totally different from the round 5-pin sockets found on
    instruments. To connect the computer to the keyboard, you will need an interface cable
    which converts the 15-pin &quot;D&quot; type to two 5-pin IN &amp; OUT connectors (there
    is no need for a THRU connector) and also provides a separate games controller port (where
    required). </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Interface cables are widely available from computer and music stores but
    there are many different specifications available. Some have games controller ports, some
    have opto-isolators, some have only MIDI IN ports, the variety can be very confusing. To
    add to the confusion, some sound card manufacturers have implemented their MIDI interface
    circuitry in subtly different ways which means that not all cables will work with every
    keyboard / computer combination. To help with the selection process, Apricot has tested a
    selection of cables with its computers and can recommend the following suppliers: </font><menu>
      <li><font size="2">Creative Labs 1013251001 Cable, MIDI CT1325A </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">Yamaha T.B.A </font></li>
    </menu>
    <p><font size="2">When you have a cable, connect the &quot;D&quot; type plug to the back
    of your PC and, if you have a games controller, connect it to the spare &quot;D&quot; type
    socket. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="graphics/midi1.jpg" width="313" height="185"> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The 5-pin MIDI plugs will be marked IN and OUT if you have two, or may
    have no markings if you are using a dumb keyboard, single plug cable. The IN / OUT
    markings refer to the direction of data flow to and from the PC or instrument, so connect
    the IN plug to the OUT socket on the keyboard and the OUT plug to the IN socket on the
    keyboard. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>Making Music With Your PC</strong><br>
    Once all the cables have been connected, the instrument won't play through the computer's
    audio card until an application capable or reading data from the MIDI port has been
    loaded. In most cases, if you have a synthesizer type keyboard, you will probably want to
    use the audio reproduction qualities of the instrument rather than the computer. However,
    if you have a dumb keyboard, the only method of hearing your composition is through the
    computer's audio hardware, so the software application you are using will probably need to
    be configured to enable this. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">On some PC models, Apricot supplies an application called Audition which
    will be used as the basis for the remaining text, however much of what follows will be
    equally applicable to any PC MIDI music package. Audition is a sixteen track notation
    based sequencer that allows you to record, replay and edit music and musical effects using
    your PC and a General MIDI, GS Sound Card or sound module. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">At Audition's main screen, click on System, select Configuration... and
    check the Thru box. This option passes the incoming MIDI data out to the designated output
    device, which by default is the computer's sound card. At this point when the instrument
    is played, music it produces through the computer's audio circuit and speakers. From this
    point you can record music, a track at a time, to create your own compositions as
    required. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you have a synthesizer type keyboard, you can play your own, or
    pre-recorded MIDI files from the computer out through your instrument. To do this you must
    tell the computer which output device to use by performing these steps. From the START
    button on the task bar, select SETTINGS and CONTROL PANEL. Choose MUTIMEDIA and select the
    MIDI tab. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="graphics/midi3.jpg" width="367" height="263"> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Select the external option and click the OK button. When you play a MIDI
    file now, it will play out through your instrument using its audio reproduction circuitry.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>Wave Table Extension</strong><br>
    When MIDI files are played by your computer, the sound card hardware synthesizes the audio
    properties of the instrument, specified in the file, in order to produce music. It's
    possible to improve the fidelity of this reproduction by using a Wave Table card. Rather
    than synthesizing instruments, a Wave Table card reproduces instrument sounds from a table
    of stored samples. This means that a piano or a flute, for example, will sound even better
    when played by the computer's audio circuit. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Wave table cards are available as options for several audio expansion
    cards and typically they are designed for use with a specific manufacturer's card. If you
    have an Apricot MS540 PC, a Wave Table expansion card is available to complement the
    onboard audio circuit. The card occupies an expansion slot and connects to the onboard
    audio circuit using a short ribbon cable. No other manufacturer's Wave Table cards may be
    used. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Once installed, Windows 95 automatically detects the card and provides
    an additional output device in the MIDI options control panel. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="graphics/midi2.jpg" width="367" height="276"> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This now gives you the option to select external output to your musical
    instrument, internal output via the computer's audio synthesizer, or internal output via
    the Wave Table expansion card. It should be noted that some difference in volume may be
    noticed when using the Wave Table option, but as this output is directed through the
    computer's audio amplifier and external speakers, if connected, then a small adjustment to
    the mixer desk will compensate for this. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Wave Table expansion cards are available through your Apricot supplier
    by requesting product code XB57690. </font></p>
    <p><strong><font size="2">Frequently Asked Questions</font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="2">Q. If I play MIDI files through my computer's audio card, why does it
    sound different than it does through my keyboard? </font><menu>
      <li><font size="2">A. MIDI files do not contain any sampled sounds, they do however contain
        instructions about the type of note to be played and the type of instrument it's to be
        played on. Actual reproduction of the instrument's characteristics is left to the
        computer's or instrument's sound generation circuits. Most computer audio cards synthesize
        instrument characteristics but if you have a Wave Table expansion card, instruments are
        reproduced from a table of sampled sounds and are therefore closer to the original. </font></li>
    </menu>
    <p><font size="2">Q. I can play MIDI files out to my keyboard, but I can't record from my
    keyboard to the computer. What's wrong? </font><menu>
      <li><font size="2">A. The most common cause of this problem is the interface cable. The
        ability to send data to the keyboard suggests that the MIDI port settings on the computer
        are correct. The computer is probably having difficulty reading in from the keyboard due
        to a compatibility problem between the interface opto-isolator circuit and the audio card
        port. </font></li>
    </menu>
    <p><font size="2">Q. What is General MIDI? </font><menu>
      <li><font size="2">A. General MIDI is an industry-wide set of specifications for sound
        sources that allow music data to be created regardless of manufacturer or specific models.
        General MIDI defines the minimum number of voices that should be recognized, what sounds
        correspond to which Program Change numbers, and the layout of rhythm sounds on the
        keyboard. </font></li>
    </menu>
    <p><font size="2">Q. What is Roland's GS Format? </font><menu>
      <li><font size="2">A. This is a Roland specification which defines the manner in which
        multi-timbral sound sources respond to MIDI messages. The GS Format includes
        specifications of sounds, functions available for tone editing, effects (chorus and
        reverb), and additional standardized parameters. Any sound source that carries the GS
        format logo is compatible with any GS Music Data.</font></li>
