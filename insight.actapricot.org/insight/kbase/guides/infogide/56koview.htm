    <p><b><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></font></b></p>
    <p><a name="1"></a><b><font size="3"><strong>How fast can a modem go?</strong></font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">The speed at which a modem transmits and receives data is expressed in
    terms of bits per second, or with modern high-speed modems, thousands of bits per second,
    abbreviated to Kbps. Modem speeds have increased over the years from a starting point of
    around 300bps to today&#146;s 33.6Kbps and even 56K devices. When we start looking at why
    there is a limit to the speed at which a modem can run, it is important to understand a
    little about what it is that a modem actually does and what the telephone network does. </font><b></p>
    <p><a name="2"></a><font size="3"><strong>What a modem does</strong></font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">Information inside your computer is in digital format: all of the data
    is stored as a series of zeroes and ones. Normal telephone lines are analogue; they were
    designed to transmit voice data as a series of constantly changing electrical peaks and
    troughs of different frequencies and varying loudness to represent intelligible speech.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The term &#145;modem&#146; actually stands for MOdulator/DEModulator,
    this being the process by which the digital signals from a computer are transformed into
    analogue signals, by a technique known as modulation, for transmission over telephone
    lines that were originally designed for the transmission of voice rather than digital
    data.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A modem, however, has to make sure that the data it sends can be
    received correctly, despite the existence of external influences, such as noise on the
    line. Finally, at the receiving end, the analogue signal has to be converted back to the
    original digital data by the technique known as demodulation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">It is this conversion process of modulation and demodulation at each end
    of the telephone connection, coupled with the limited bandwidth (the amount of information
    that can be carried at any one time) and the inherent noise of an analogue telephone line
    that imposes a limit on the maximum speed at which a modem can reliably transfer data.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In the late seventies, William Shannon of Bell Laboratories came up with
    Shannon's Law, which set a theoretical limit for modem speeds over analogue circuits at
    about 34Kbps.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Current 33.6Kbps V.34 modems push analogue telephone lines to the limit,
    and represent the &#145;state of the art&#146; for conventional modems. In future,
    increases in dial-up bandwidth will depend on all-digital circuits (see &#145;Into the
    future&#146; below). At one time it was thought that 33.6Kbps would be as fast as you
    could get - to get higher speeds, you'd need modems using totally different technologies
    that just wouldn't work over standard phone lines. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The advent of 56K modems has changed that. You can now have a faster
    connection using your existing telephone line and new modems that work just like your old
    modem, but faster, although there are some provisos. </font><b></p>
    <p><a name="3"></a><font size="3"><strong>Digital developments</strong></font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">Today's telephone network is increasingly digital. In particular, the
    telephone connection between the telephone company and the Internet Service Provider (ISP)
    is often digital rather than analogue. Digital lines still have some inherent noise, and
    are still subject to performance limits, but they have less noise and a higher potential
    speed than the analogue variety.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In fact, one of the few remaining types of analogue circuits is the
    local analogue loop that connects the normal household telephone to the telephone
    exchange. The actual telephone network that connects exchanges together is digital in
    nature, but is designed to connect these analogue local loops together. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The network itself, therefore, has analogue-to-digital converters,
    situated at the exchange, to take traffic from the home telephone or modem and convert it
    for transmission across the digital network, and digital-to-analogue converters at the
    remote exchange to reverse the process for transmission to the remote user&#146;s
    telephone or modem. Let&#146;s look at what happens when two home users &#145;A&#146; and
    &#145;B&#146; connect their computers together using dial-up modems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The telephone network will first convert the analogue signal transmitted
    from user A's modem to a digital signal which will then be transmitted digitally from the
    telephone exchange in user A's area to the telephone exchange in the user B's area. At
    user B&#146;s telephone exchange, the digital signal will be converted back to an analogue
    signal before being sent via analogue phone line to user B's modem. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The digital-to-analogue conversion of signals received at user B&#146;s
    exchange causes no problem to transmission. However, the telephone network's
    analogue-to-digital converter at user A&#146;s exchange introduces noise problems (called
    quantization noise) as a result of which the maximum speed is therefore determined,
    according to Shannon's Law, at around 34Kbps.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Where an Internet Service Provider has a digital connection to the
    telephone company, 56K technology takes advantage of the fact that the network has no
    analogue-to-digital conversions in the end-user's downloading (downstream) path, which
    effectively eliminates the quantization noise problems introduced by the telephone
    network.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Several companies have created techniques that take advantage of the
    digital portion of the telephone network to achieve higher speeds than were possible with
    a purely analogue pathway. These new techniques treat the telephone system as a digital
    network that has just one analogue link between the user and the telephone exchange.</font><b></p>
    <p><a name="4"></a><font size="3"><strong>Enter the 56K modem</strong></font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">The basis of 56K technology is different to that used in existing
    analogue modems. In particular, it depends completely on the existence of a half-digital
    connection to achieve its higher speeds, and can therefore only give its speed advantage
    over 33.6Kbps modems in certain situations. The most common of these is when you connect
    to the Internet via an Internet Service Provider (ISP) who provides 56K modem support,
    such as Infotrade.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The reason 56K modems are able to break Shannon's barrier is that,
    strictly speaking, they aren't modems at all. They depend on digital connections from the
    telecom company, through the Internet Service Providers, and onto the Internet. In this
    digital world, Shannon's limitations no longer apply.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This necessity for a half-digital connection does impose some
    fundamental requirements. Your Internet service provider (ISP) must have digital phone
    lines to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and there cannot be more than one
    analogue-to-digital conversion in your local phone loop. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Furthermore, there are two major 56K technologies that are
    non-interoperable: you have to buy a 56K modem that uses the same 56K technology used in
    your Internet Service Provider's modem. See &#145;Not one standard but two&#146;, below.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If any of these restrictions apply to you, you can't use 56K modems to
    their full advantage, and your connection will be limited to V.34 speeds (a maximum of
    33.6Kbps).</font><b></p>
    <p><a name="5"></a><font size="3"><strong>You don&#146;t get it both ways</strong></font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">A 56K connection is asymmetric: it's faster for downloading than for
    uploading. Downloading means receiving data from another computer (for example, viewing a
    Web page or receiving email). Uploading means sending data to another computer (for
    example, sending email or sending keystrokes and mouse clicks to a Web page).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The download speed can be as much as 56Kbps, but the upload speed will
    be only 28.8Kbps or 33.6Kbps. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Why the limit? When downloading over a 56K connection, the downstream
    data from the exchange to your modem is digitally encoded instead of modulated, and is
    changed from a digital signal to an analogue signal at the modem. Digital-to-analogue
    conversions are perfectly accurate, so downloading at speeds up to 56Kbps is possible.
    When uploading, data is sent in a modulated form and has to be converted from an analogue
    signal to a digital signal. Analogue-to-digital conversions are imperfect, so noise is
    introduced into the signal, resulting in a lower upload speed.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2"><img SRC="GRAPHICS/56k01.gif.html" width="557" height="175"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">However, this lower upload speed isn't significant for most users. Most
    Internet surfers spend far more time downloading than uploading, and most of their
    uploading consists of little more than key strokes and mouse clicks.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Many other high-speed technologies, e.g. ADSL and cable modems, (see
    &#145;Into the future&#146; below) also have asymmetric rates. V.34 modems (28.8Kbps and
    33.6Kbps) support asymmetric connections to compensate for poor line quality in one
    direction, but in this case the upload and download rates are usually very close to one
    another. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The asymmetric nature of 56K technology does mean that it is not a
    panacea. In particular, it makes 56K impractical for any application where the amount of
    data flowing in each direction is roughly equal, for example in the case of
    video-conferencing. For those applications, ISDN is superior.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Nevertheless, if surfing the Web is what you do most, it&#146;s the
    download speed from the Internet to you that you&#146;re going to benefit from.</font><b></p>
    <p><a name="6"></a><font size="3"><strong>Not one standard, but two</strong></font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">With standard modems you can normally connect any modem to another of
    the same speed with no problem because they follow international standard protocols,
    specified by an organisation known as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). A
    protocol is simply the set of rules that the transmitting and receiving modems both abide
    by so that they can understand each other. For example, V.34 is the name of the standard
    that defines the protocol for 33.6Kbps modems to talk to each other.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The first and most important thing you need to know about 56K modems is
    that there are two 56K protocols, and that these protocols are incompatible. These
    proprietary 56K protocols are known as x2&#153; from U.S. Robotics (now merged with 3Com),
    and K56flex&#153; from Rockwell and Lucent. Modem manufacturers who produce 56K modems
    will use one or the other of these two protocols.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you buy a modem that uses K56flex protocol, you won't be able to call
    a modem using the x2 protocol and get the full speed. You will, however, still be able to
    connect at 28.8 or 33.6Kbps, so in that sense you haven&#146;t really lost anything
    compared with a 33.6Kbps modem. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">An ITU standard for 56K isn't likely until sometime during the second
    half of 1998 at the earliest. Which one of these will become the standard? In all
    probability it will be neither, but instead it will most likely be a combination of
    elements of both the current x2 and K56flex technologies. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Until there's a standard, which one should you choose: K56flex or x2?
    One answer is to choose the one your Internet Service Provider is using or is going to use
    (or choose an ISP who provides support for both). Whatever you do, you should check that
    the modem you are going to buy will be upgradable - preferably by a free software program
    - to the final ITU-T 56K standard when it is established. That way your investment is
    protected for the future.</font><b></p>
    <p><a name="7"></a><font size="3"><strong>Modem connection speeds</strong></font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you were one of the first people to buy a 28.8Kbps modem, you may
    have discovered that most of the places that you called still used 14.4Kbps modems, so you
    could only connect at 14.4K. It's always been this way with modems: they can only connect
    at the highest speed supported by either modem, or by the quality of the telephone
    connection.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Many people who buy high-speed analogue modems are sometimes surprised
    that they don't necessarily connect at the full 33.6Kbps (or 28.8Kbps) rated speed, and
    connections at 26400 or 24000 are common. Let&#146;s look at why this is.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The rated speed for a modem is the maximum at which the modem is capable
    of performing, given an optimum telephone connection. However, the modem is only one part
    of the communications link and it must be remembered, as discussed earlier, that it is the
    inherent noise of an analogue telephone line that imposes a limit on the maximum speed at
    which a modem can reliably transfer data. Modems will automatically select the highest
    speed at which this reliability can be maintained, which will frequently be less than its
    rated maximum.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because the part of the connection between your computer and the
    telephone company is analogue, 56K modems will still suffer from line noise. The upside is
    that with 56K connections, the link between the telephone company and the Internet service
    provider is digital, which has much less noise.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Even if you can't get a 28.8Kbps or 33.6Kbps connect on your existing
    analogue modem, you may be able to get a higher connect speed with 56K.</font></p>
    <p><a name="8"></a><b><font size="3"><strong>Limitations</strong></font></p>
    </b><p><font size="2">The technology used in 56K modems has two possible drawbacks. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Firstly, for 56K to work, you cannot have more than one
    analogue-to-digital conversion between your home or office and the Internet service
    provider (ISP). If there's more than one, you can't use 56K, and your connection will be
    limited to V.34 speeds (a maximum of 33.6Kbps). If your office is on a PBX, you may also
    have problems getting speeds higher than 33.6 or 28.8K. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Secondly, there are two major 56K technologies, K56flex&#153; and
    x2&#153;, and these are mutually exclusive, so you have to buy a 56K modem that uses the
    same 56K technology used in your Internet Service Provider's modem, or choose an Internet
    Service Provider who offers both, such as Infotrade.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limitations, x2 is
    limited to 53Kbps in the U.S. To reach the speed of 56Kbps, an x2 modem would need to
    increase the power sent down the telephone line beyond a limit set by the FCC years ago.
    Note that because of its different technological approach, K56flex is not affected in this
    way. This isn't a major issue, as most people probably wouldn't connect at the full 56Kbps
    anyway, due to the telephone line constraints that prevent many people from connecting at
    28.8 or 33.6Kbps (see &#145;Modem connection speeds&#146;). In any event, the difference
    between 53Kbps and 56Kbps is hardly of great significance.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The whole concept of 56K technology depends on the ISP having digital
    phone lines connecting their modems to the telephone company. The digital lines are much
    clearer than analogue phone lines, so higher connection speeds are possible. And another
    big advantage of 56K is that although the ISP has to have a special digital connection,
    you can continue to use the local analogue phone line you already have. </font></p>
    <b><p><a name="9"></a><font size="3"><strong>Into the future</strong></font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">Other technologies already exist that are faster than 56Kbps. The most
    popular is the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) which is a completely digital
    circuit. The downside to ISDN is the cost.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Digital leased lines are also available, called T1, T2, T3 or T4 - these
    are, however, very expensive.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Entering the late stages of development is another technology,
    Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL). Whilst ISDN is limited to 64kbps, ADSL uses
    speeds of 640kbps to upload, and speeds in excess of 6Mbps (mega-bits per second) to
    download. Also entering the market are &quot;Cable&quot; (cable phone/cable TV) companies
    and even power companies. Norweb, for example, recently announced technology that allows
    data to be transferred over electricity power lines into the home at speeds of over 1Mbps
    (megabit per second).</font></p>
