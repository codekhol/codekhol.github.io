    size="2">Or rather, plug and go mad with frustration. Don't blame yourself, says Nick
    Edmunds. The inadequacy of the PC is at fault, overwhelmed on all sides by technical
    advice. </font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="2">Did you consider taking an axe to your PC when you last installed a
    sound card? Did you wonder, despite following the manufacturer's instructions to the
    letter, if that expensive CD-ROM drive upgrade would ever work? Did the experience make
    you feel inadequate and technically challenged? Worry not; it's not you, it's the system. </font></p>

    <p><em><font size="2">Fig 1: System bus and node layout </font></em></p>
    <p><font size="2">Blame IBM, blame Microsoft, blame history, but don't blame yourself.
    According to Intel, up to 50 percent of support calls to computer vendors relate to
    configuration issues. Forty five percent of Microsoft's Windows support calls are due to,
    not software, but hardware compatibility problems. And in the US, of all multimedia kits
    sold by the CompUSA superstore chain, no less than 25 percent are returned by crazed users
    who have quite simply had enough and thrown in the towel. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">When it comes to upgrades, the now completely inadequate architecture of
    the PC, overwhelmed by technical advice on all sides, is beginning to hold back not just
    performance, but worse: sales. Users, particularly those new to computers, are being
    turned off by the PC's problems and instead are buying Macs. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A solution is needed, and after only 13 years of IBM-initiated aggro,
    Intel and Microsoft in conjunction with a bandwagon of other suppliers, from AMI to
    Compaq, are at least providing the answer: Plug and Play. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Plug and Play means being able to take any card from any manufacturer,
    bung it into any PC and it will work. First time. Sceptical? You should be; but having
    seen three ISA Plug and Play sound cards in one machine all simultaneously pumping out
    their own tunes, this user was impressed. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We have seen solutions to the expansion card configuration problems in
    the past. Both EISA (Extended Industry Standard Architecture) and IBM's proprietary MCA
    (Micro Channel Architecture) addressed the issue. Install a new EISA or MCA card, run the
    bus configuration software and your cards would all talk to your machine without conflict.
    However, despite these systems being more sophisticated, price stopped the customers
    buying. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">ISA was, and still is, cheap. Cheap and nasty. ISA has no mechanism for
    configuration management, but nevertheless the ISA bus architecture requires allocation of
    resources. Parts of the system bewildering to the newcomer, such as memory and I/O address
    spaces, DMA channels and interrupts, have to be shared out among multiple cards. But there
    is no proper hardware or software interface to sort it out. It's a mess. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>What's wrong with ISA? </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Before we look in wonderment at the pain-relieving Plug and Play, it is
    worth examining exactly what the existing problem with ISA is. When you attempt to install
    an ISA sound card, it has to be configured so that it does not conflict with devices
    currently installed in your system. There are three main areas of potential interference.
    The first is the card's IRQ (Interrupt Request Line), 7 typically being the factory
    default. If a process or device wants to get a piece of the action in your system it needs
    to interrupt the CPU. Thus if the CPU receives an interrupt - or signal - down line 7,
    say, it knows it is the sound card talking. If anything else uses the same IRQ it is going
    to get confused. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The second consideration is the I/O port base address. This is a small
    (8-byte) contiguous area of RAM which represents where data can be sent or received. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The third resource that needs worrying about is the DMA channel for
    Direct Memory Access. The CPU does not want to be involved in every operation in the
    system and a block data transfer can be set up directly between a device and memory to
    free up the processor. A DMA channel therefore has to be selected for this to take place. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Configuring the card in this way actually points the various signals to
    different pins on the bus. All these three aspects of system resources have to be set for
    each device but nowhere is there a central database of configuration details, hence the
    pain of installing additional cards. It is trial and error while the user plays with
    hardware jumper settings on the card itself and fiddles with other parameters in the
    configuration software. Worse still, some IRQs may be available on the system, say, 2, 5,
    7 or 10, but the card itself cannot use them as it has a limited range. This then means
    some other device has to have its IRQ changed first in order to accommodate the new card
    you are installing. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Enter Plug and Play. First the bad news: your current system is not
    compatible. Small but significant changes must be made to the design of the motherboard
    and to new expansion cards to make them Plug and Play ready. A tiny amount of additional
    logic and storage needs to be built into both, adding around $5 to each. Adapting existing
    motherboard designs will be easy and the change to cards simple, but unfortunately,
    updating your own PC to Plug and Play may not be viable. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The glimmer of good news is that non-Plug and Play cards will work in
    Plug and Play motherboards, and Plug and Play cards will work in non-Plug and Play
    motherboards. Plug and Play is not just for ISA and specifications are being developed for
    SCSI, PCMCIA, MCA, EISA, VL and IDE. PCI is apparently Plug and Play ready. One might
    question why Intel is bothering with the Plug and Play ISA problem if PCI (the Intel
    developed bus standard) already does the job. The answer is cost. PCI chipsets are still
    expensive compared with ISA and in sales volume ISA systems will swamp PCI PCs. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Plug and Play, formally introduced to the world in March 1993, works at
    three levels: the Configuration Utility, the Configuration Manager, and the extensions to
    the operating system BIOS that provides basic boot-strapping and initial configuration
    data. This last point tells us why existing systems cannot be upgraded. Flash (upgradeable
    on the board) BIOS would be okay given sufficient capacity (the Plug and Play code
    requires extra space) but standard ROM BIOS machines would have to stay non-Plug and Play
    compatible. The Configuration Utility (held on disk) runs at boot time, checking out and
    setting up system resources, while the Configuration Manager is an application users can
    run when installing new cards. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Multiple bus systems</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The automatic configuration of system resources and expansion cards in
    an ISA system is a complicated business made even more complex by the existence of
    multiple bus systems. Indeed, some buses such as PCMCIA are hidden until initialised. If
    we examine the block diagram below representing the hierarchical bus structure of a
    typical multi-bus system we begin to appreciate the size of the Plug and Play
    auto-configuration task. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If we call each box in the diagram a node, then to configure the system
    we need to know: the unique node identification code, the resource requirements of each
    node, the resources already allocated to each node, and whether the node is a bus and
    therefore has 'child' nodes. Plug and Play uses 'bus enumerators' which assign specific
    unique ID codes to each device on a bus and retrieve configuration information from each
    device. 'Old' ISA cards cannot be read so a database is maintained on the system of this
    data, updatable by the Configuration Manager. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">With the user happily plugging and playing, a typical job for Plug and
    Play would be to address two ISA cards uniquely which both ask for the same resources. In
    this case, Plug and Play has to establish each card's requirements and options and then
    modify the card's configuration. The Plug and Play process puts all cards and devices in
    configuration mode to isolate and deal with them one at a time. The appropriate resources
    are then allocated to the device, dependent on options built into the card and what
    resources are left (such as available DMA channels). If a card cannot be configured, the
    configuration of other cards is switched around to let it fit in. Clever. When the Plug
    and Play configuration program is happy that everything is hunky dory, the cards are
    switched from configuration mode to 'active' mode and the system is ready. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Portable plug and play</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Plug and Play has plenty of future, particularly in the fast-growing
    portable computing arena. 'Hot swapping' of removable hard disks and PCMCIA cards is
    especially suited to an intelligent 'active' device auto-configuration system like Plug
    and Play. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Intel is currently offering three Plug and Play development kits: the
    Plug and Play for DOS and Windows Kit, for the development of PCs and drivers; the Plug
    and Play ISA Hardware Demo Kit to test out developers' products. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Plug and Play looks good, sounds good and we should see those
    auto-configuring systems and cards becoming widely available by the middle of the year.
    So, if you want to buy a new PC today, should you wait for one of these new machines? If
    you can hold on, do. After all, do you really want to resort to the axe again?</font></p>
