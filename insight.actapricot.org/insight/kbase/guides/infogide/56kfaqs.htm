    <b><p><a name="1"></a><font size="2">Are 56K modems just a further development of V.34
    modems?</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">No. 56K technology is based on a totally different concept from V.34
    modems. It will only work where the end-user modem connects, via analogue phone line, to a
    server-site modem which is directly linked to the digital telephone network via a T1 or
    PRI line. This new type of connection can be referred to as a home-to-ISP (Internet
    Service Provider) connection</font></p>
    <b><p></b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="2"></a><b><font size="2">What is K56flex&#153;? </font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">Two manufacturers, Lucent Technologies and Rockwell, produce modem chip
    sets that implement the same 56K technology. The high-speed modem protocol employed by
    these devices is called K56flex&#153;.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="3"></a><font size="2">What is x2&#153;?</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">x2&#153; Technology is the name of a transmission scheme developed by US
    Robotics (now part of 3Com) that is capable of line speeds of up to 56Kbps.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="4"></a><font size="2">When will there be a single standard for 56K modems?</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">An ITU standard for 56K isn't likely until sometime during the second
    half of 1998 at the earliest. Will K56flex or x2 become the standard? In all probability
    it will be neither, but instead it will most likely be a combination of elements of both
    the current x2 and K56flex technologies.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="5"></a><font size="2">Which modem technology to choose - K56flex or x2?</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">One answer is to choose the one your Internet Service Provider is using
    or is going to use (or choose an ISP who provides support for both). Whatever you do, you
    should check that the modem you are going to buy will be upgradable - preferably by a free
    software program - to the final ITU-T 56K standard when it is established. That way your
    investment is protected for the future.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="6"></a><font size="2">Experts said that 33.6Kbps was about as fast as a modem
    could go - how does 56K technology exceed this?</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">Shannon's Law theoretically defines the maximum line speed based on the
    impairments (including all kind of noise) in the telephone link between two points and the
    bandwidth of the channel. In home-to-home connections, the telephone network will first
    convert the analogue signal transmitted from user A's modem to a digital signal. This will
    then be transmitted digitally from the telephone exchange in user A's area to the exchange
    in user B's area. This digital signal will be converted back to an analogue signal before
    being sent via analogue phone line to user B's modem. The telephone network's
    analogue-to-digital converter introduces noise, technically called quantization noise, and
    the maximum speed determined by Shannon's Law is around 35 Kbps using this type of
    connection. In a home-to-ISP type of connection, 56K technology takes advantage of the
    fact that the network has no analogue-to-digital converter in the end-user's downloading
    path. This eliminates the quantization noise that would have been introduced if the
    connection from the server to the telephone network were analogue.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="7"></a><font size="2">Why is there a limit on the upload speed of a 56K modem?
    </font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">When downloading over a 56K connection, data is passed directly to the
    digital telephone network and requires no conversion until it reaches the end-user&#146;s
    telephone exchange. Here the data is changed from a digital signal to an analogue signal.
    Conversion of a signal from digital-to-analogue does not cause any impairment to the data,
    so downloading at speeds up to 56Kbps is possible. However, when uploading, data is
    changed from an analogue signal to a digital signal by a process known as quantization.
    There is a problem here because analogue waveforms are continuous and binary numbers are
    discrete, so when the digits that are sent across the telephone network are converted back
    at the other end, the resultant signal only approximates to the original analogue
    waveform. The difference between the original analogue waveform and the reconstructed
    quantized waveform is called quantization noise. This noise limits modem speed.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="8"></a><font size="2">Will the upstream speed be limited to V.34 rates? </font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">At the moment, yes. The initial implementations of 56K technology use
    V.34 rates for upstream (uploading) data. Future developments may utilise additional
    techniques to enable rates higher than V.34 rates in the upstream direction. </font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="9"></a><font size="2">Is it worth having a modem that only offers a higher
    speed in one direction? </font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">The great majority of Internet traffic is asymmetrical in that the
    largest amount of data travels from the Internet to the end user (downstream) in the form
    of text and graphics. Most communication from the end user to the Internet (upstream)
    consists only of mouse clicks and keystrokes. 56K technology is therefore ideally suited
    to Internet connections.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="10"></a><font size="2">Can a 56K modem be used for anything other than a
    &quot;home-to-ISP&quot; connection to the Internet? </font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">Yes, although Internet connection is the obvious use. 56K technology
    could also be useful for other applications, subject to the proviso that at least one end
    of the connection is digitally terminated. For example, it could find application in
    business solutions where users connect to a private business server and where most data
    traffic is downstream from the server to the end user.</font></p>
    <b><p></b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="11"></a><b><font size="2">Can two 56K modems connect at speeds in excess of
    V.34 when used in a home-to-home connection? </font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">No, they can&#146;t. 56K technology is designed for home-to-ISP
    connections and demands that the ISP site has a digital connection to the telephone
    network and that the end user connects to an analogue phone line. However, you can still
    use 56K modems for home-to-home communications because in this case the modems will
    automatically connect to each other in V.34. </font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="12"></a><font size="2">Can I use a 56K modem to connect to an ordinary
    analogue modem such as V.34? </font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">Yes you can. A 56K modem automatically detects the capabilities of a
    remote modem and will use a feature called &quot;automode&quot; to match itself to the
    capability of the remote modem. And remember, if the rules for a half-digital connection
    are broken, a 56K modem will fall back to a V.34 connection.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="13"></a><font size="2">If I buy a 56K modem, will I always connect at 56Kbps? </font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">You can only achieve 56K rates when you connect to a compatible 56K
    modem at an ISP that has a digital connection to the telephone network. Therefore, 56K
    modems must be in use at all the sites you plan to connect to, and furthermore they must
    be of compatible types (K56flex&#153; or x2&#153;). In addition, remember that the speed
    of 56Kbps demands a perfect telephone connection; in practice you can expect to connect at
    a slower speed than this.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="14"></a><font size="2">Will different makes of 56K modems connect with each
    other? </font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">The first and most important thing you need to know about 56K modems is
    that there are two 56K protocols, and that these protocols are incompatible. These
    proprietary 56K protocols are known as x2&#153; from U.S. Robotics (now merged with 3Com),
    and K56flex&#153; from Rockwell and Lucent Technologies. Modem manufacturers who produce
    56K modems will use one or the other of these two protocols.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you buy a modem that uses K56flex protocol, you won't be able to call
    a modem using the x2 protocol and get the full speed. 56K modems will, however, fall back
    to a V.34 connection if the other modem is not compatible, so you can still connect even
    though it won&#146;t be at 56Kbps.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="15"></a><font size="2">Is it true that 56K modems are limited to 53Kbps?</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">Partly true. Because of FCC limitations, x2 is effectively limited to
    53Kbps in the U.S., at least initially, but K56flex is not affected. This isn't a major
    issue, as most people probably wouldn't connect at the full 56Kbps anyway, due to the
    telephone line constraints that prevent many people from connecting at 28.8 or 33.6Kbps.
    In any event, the difference between 53Kbps and 56Kbps is hardly of great significance.</font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="16"></a><font size="2">If I can't even achieve 28.8Kbps / 33.6Kbps now, should
    I even consider a 56K modem?&quot;</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">The answer is that you can get potentially higher connection speeds with
    56K. The half-digital nature of 56K means that your connect rates will be higher than with
    pure analogue technology. </font></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="17"></a><font size="2">Does 56K technology mean there is now no need for ISDN?</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">No, it doesn&#146;t mean that at all. In fact, ISDN can provide much
    higher data transmission speeds. Also, bear in mind that the fastest speed the 56K modems
    can reach is heavily dependent on the telephone line conditions and other network related
    issues. On the other hand, the wholly digital nature of ISDN means that its higher speeds
    are virtually guaranteed. The 56K modems are designed specifically for end users that want
    higher speed connections to the Internet without having to change their existing analogue
    telephone connection.</font></p>
