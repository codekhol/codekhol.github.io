     |          File area # 38 .. VX_Net Release 3.14 Files           |
     +----------------------------------------------------------------+
 
 The files below make the new VX_Net release 3.14.
 
 The four main .EXE files are self unpacking files that should be run from
 the hard disk of a system onto blank HD formatted floppies... ie, if the .EXE
 files were on drive C: and a blank formatted High Density diskette is in Drive
 A:, you would do the following....
 
        1) Change to drive A: (A: {return})
        2) run the .EXE from drive C: (C:VX314_1 -D {return})
 
        Note that the -D switch is needed when unpacking these files.
 
 You should ensure that you have 6 blank High Density floppies, formatted with
 no system tracks and no volume label. You should also have a copy of the
 Combined DOS pack (also available below).
 
 NOTE: Before installing the upgrade, we would advise that a full system
 backup is taken and verified for data integrety. We would also recommend that
 if possible a test installation is carried out before upgrading a live site,
 so that you can familiarise yourself with the changes in the new installation
 routine (as there are quite a few).
 
 For those that would like the upgrade on floppy disk rather than downloading
 the files, please send 6 * 3.5' High Density floppy disks to....

 For those that don't want the full install/upgrade pack, some of the new
 files are below. Please however be extremely careful when upgrading parts
 of the network software when the rest of the software is remaining at a lower
 release. If problems are encountered, we would advise that the full upgrade
 as above be installed before the System Support Group are consulted.
