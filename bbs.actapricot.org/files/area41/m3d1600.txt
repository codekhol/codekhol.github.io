Software Installation: Win 9x
-----------------------------
These instructions assume that the Monster 3D is already installed and
functioning, and that this web-based driver is being used as an upgrade.  
Otherwise, please refer to the Starter Pack that came with the Monster 3D 
for first time installation instructions.

    2. Double click on the executable (.exe) to extract to a temporary 
       directory.

    3. Right-click on My Computer and choose Properties.
 
    4. Choose the Device Manager tab and double click on Sound, Video, and 
       Game Controllers (or Multimedia).

    5. Double click on the Monster 3D PCI Video Multimedia Device.
    
    6. Click on the Driver tab and then click the Change Driver button.  
       Monster 3D PCI Video Multimedia Device should be highlighted.
    
    7. Click on the Have Disk button.
 
    8. Type the appropriate path to the Monster 3D Windows 95 drivers 
       (where the extracted files-#2 above, reside)
	    
    9. When files begin copying, Windows may ask you for the location of
       the drivers a second time.  Simply type in the same path that was
       entered in step #8, above.  After the files have been copied, click 
       the OK to Restart your computer.
    

	

    
Running MOJO.EXE
----------------
Mojo is a version application.  It will printout the version information
about the Monster 3D board.

It will not run without DirectDraw 5 installed.  If DirectDraw 5 is
not installed then a dialog appears stating that DDRAW.DLL cannot be
found.  To fix this problem install DirectDraw 5.

Known Limitations
-----------------
  Refresh Rate in GLIDE Games:

  Refresh rate is completely under the control of the GLIDE games.
  However, the refresh selection in the panel sets an MSDOS environment
  variable that modifies the refresh rate according to the user
  selection at 640x480 only.  Click the Apply to DOS... check button to
  reboot the system and apply the refresh rate to GLIDE games.

  Gamma Correction in GLIDE Games:
  Gamma correction is completely under the control of the GLIDE games. 
  However, the gamma selection in the panel sets an MSDOS environment variable
  that modifies the red, green, and blue gamma values according to the user
  selection at 640x480 only.  Click the Apply to DOS... check button to
  reboot the system and apply the gamma selection to GLIDE games.
 
  Monster 3D Settings Panel:

  The "Test" button in the gamma area of the Monster 3D Settings panel
  purposely uses 640x480 at 60 Hz. This way the user can test gamma with
  a consistent resolution and refresh rate that works correctly on any
  VGA monitor.

  The "Test" button in the resolution/refresh area brings the display up
  in the selected resolution/refresh using the current selected gamma.

  The "Test" buttons effectively change the settings before running the
  test application.  Therefore the meaning of Cancel changes to be the
  last time any "Test" button was used.

NOTE:
Glide games have control over resolution/refresh and gamma.  Thus,
resolution/refresh and gamma selections in the Monster 3D panel may
not apply to Glide games.

NOTE:
Gamma correction does not apply to the following resolutions:
	512x384 at 85 Hz and greater
	640x400 at 85 Hz and greater
	640x480 at 85 Hz and greater
	800x600 at 60 Hz and greater


Direct3D
--------
Some games do not find the dd3dfx drivers.  They only run on the
software version of Direct3D or the Direct3D HAL associated with the
Primary DirectDraw device.

When running the DirectX SDK applications, you cannot get to the menus
because the 3DFX Direct3D does not turn off pass-thru mode for a menu
command.

Technology Demos and the Joystick
---------------------------------
The 3DFX Flip/Rotate demos will not work properly if your system has a 
joystick port configured without a joystick connected. To remedy the problem, 
either connect a joystick to the port or disable and/or remove the port from 
your system configuration.
