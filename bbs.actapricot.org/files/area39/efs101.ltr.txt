Micro Channel Extended Feature Supplement
for SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear SCO UNIX System V/386 Customer,

The Santa Cruz Operation is pleased to ship you this release of the Micro 
Channel SCSI Exteneded Feature Supplement (EFS).  We are continually adding 
new functionality to SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 and use this means
to provide added functionality to our customers between major releases of
the product.

This EFS provides additional support for computers based on Micro Channel 
Architectures, including the following IBM Personal System/2 models: 65-061,
65-121, 80-121, 80-321, 80-A21, 80-A31.

These machines contain an IBM SCSI host adaptor used to operate the hard disk,
and potentially other devices.

This EFS consists of two diskettes, a replacement N1 to be used instead of the 
one supplied with the operating system, and a link-kit update disk to provide
the additional driver support in the link-kit.  The notes contained here 
supplement the original Release Notes.


Installing the Operating System with this Supplement
====================================================

1.  Remove the N1 disk from the original distribution of the operating system
    diskettes, and replace it with the N1 provided with this supplement.

2.  Install the operating system on the machine as usual.

3.  Install the operating system link-kit using the custom utility.

4.  Install the Maintenance Supplement Update A diskettes.

    When prompted after the kernel re-link, DO NOT shutdown and reboot the
    system, but continue and install the link-kit disk that came with this
    supplement, using the "Add a Supported Product" option in custom.  This
    will add additional driver support to the link-kit.

5.  Shutdown the system and reboot.

6.  Continue the rest of the installation as normal.

                                   ----
