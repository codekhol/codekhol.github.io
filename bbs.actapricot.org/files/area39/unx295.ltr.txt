        
Dear SCO Customer,
        
The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx295, the SCO UNIX System V/386 
Pseudo-tty SLS, contains the pseudo-tty driver with enhanced performance. This 
driver replaces the old version Driver.o located in /etc/conf/pack.d/spt.

3.2 Operating System Version 2.0.

you have configured your system correctly.  Your operating system must be the
