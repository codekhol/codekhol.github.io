<p>
Throughout this Info Guide the following typefaces have special meaning:<p>
<pre>
<b>dptmgr</b>        - The name of a command, file, menu item,
                or on screen option.
<i>Boot</i>          - Output displayed on screen.
<u>alad dptr</u>     - Keyboard input
<b><i>Logical</i></b>       - Terminology used by DPT and is described
                in the DPT
<b><i>Storage Unit</i></b>  - SmartRAID user's manual.
</pre>
<p>
This Info Guide makes the following assumptions:<p>
<ul>
 <li>	That the DPT card and the hot-plug backplane have been installed in the
FT//ex.  For guidance with these tasks review the installation documentation
supplied with them.

 <li>	That a single array of drives configured as a RAID 5 array is to be installed.
This type of array provides drive redundancy without the need for duplicating
the entire array of drives with a mirrored array, and provides a disk
performance increase through striping.  RAID 5 requires at least 3 drives.
Assuming all drives are of the same size, an amount of storage capacity equal
to that of one drive in the array is lost, it being used throughout the array
to hold parity information for rebuilding data should a drive fail.  So, for an
array of 5 drives each of 1Gb, the size of the logical drive that the DPT card
offers the host is 4Gb.

 <li>	That SCO Unix 3.2v4.2 is to be installed from a SCSI tape set to ID 2, or a
CD-ROM set to ID 5, connected to the on-board AIC-7870.  There are potential
problems with using the 7870 for installation and these will be discussed and
an alternative offered.  These SCSI ID's are mandatory for installation, this
being an SCO feature.
</ul>
<p>
Only Apricot supported drives for the FT//ex with DPT card should be used.  At
the time of writing such drives being the Quantum 540Mb, IBM DPES-31080 1Gb
"Pegasus", and IBM 2Gb "Starfire".  For earlier Apricot supplied drives check
with Unix Support.
</p>
<p>
Follow these notes in the order written to start from an unconfigured system
through to SCO Unix installed onto a RAID 5 drive array.
</p>

<h1 align=center>
 <a name="RTFToC2">FT//ex 1000 RAID system configuration</a>
</h1>

<p>
Prior to configuring the RAID array or installing software onto any hard disks,
the system's configuration must be checked as outlined in the following
sub-sections.
</p>

<p>
There are four separate software/BIOS setups to be run, these are:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> The motherboard "BIOS Utility"
 <li> The DPT card "DPT Configuration Utility"
 <li> The Adaptec AIC-7870 on-board PCI SCSI controller "SCSISelect(TM)
Utilty"
 <li> The "EISA System Configuration Utility" or ECU.
</ul>

<p>
These quoted names are the names of these setup utilities as they appear
on-screen.
</p>

<h2>
 <a name="RTFToC21">Hold F10 to make system boot</a>
</h2>

<p>
At boot-up the system should display output from the DPT BIOS and the Adaptec
AIC 7870 BIOS.  If either are missing or if the system does not boot DOS from
one of the hard disks (systems are supplied with DOS installed from our
factory), assume that there is a problem with stored CMOS configuration and
power on again with the F10 key held down until the system beeps once.
</p>

<p>
This will reset the CMOS configuration to a working state that will allow the
floppy to boot and the ECU to be run.  Pressing F10 in this way does not affect
the ECU settings that are in place.  See the later sub-section entitled "ECU
settings" for the settings required.
</p>

<p>
After configuring the ECU you must configure the settings in the motherboard
"BIOS Utility", the DPT card "DPT Configuration Utility", and the Adaptec
AIC-7870 on-board PCI SCSI controller "SCSISelect(TM) Utilty".  These settings,
and the ECU settings, that should be defined are detailed in the following
sub-sections.
</p>

<h2>
 <a name="RTFToC22">ECU settings</a>
</h2>

<p>
Firstly review the ECU settings.  After the ECU has booted select the
<b>Configure computer - advanced method</b> option.  At this point the EISA
slots 1 to 5 are listed and so is the system motherboard.  Select the
motherboard - the menu option <b>M5</b>.
</p>

<p>
Shown below is the ECU listing for the motherboard with comments included to
give relevant explanations:
</p>

<pre>
System Memory Functions
 Base System Memory............640K Base Memory
 4   -   16MB Extended Memory..<b>16MB</b> Ext Memory with 15-16MB System used
</pre>

<p>
For systems with at least 16MB the above is set to <b>16MB</b>.
</p>

<pre>
 16  -   64MB Extended Memory  Ctrl-R to add the Memory
</pre>

<p>
For memory up from 16Mb to 64Mb enter <u>&lt;cntrl&gt;R</u> followed by
<u>&lt;tab&gt;</u> and then enter the value of the memory in megabytes (as a
number followed by <u>M</u>) above 16Mb.  Eg. for a 32Mb system, enter
<u>16M</u>.
</p>

<pre>
 64  -  128MB Extended Memory  Ctrl-R to add the Memory
</pre>

<p>
For memory up from 64Mb to 128Mb enter <u>&lt;cntrl&gt;R</u> followed by
<u>&lt;tab&gt;</u> and then enter the value of the memory in megabytes (as a
number followed by <u>M</u>) above 64Mb.  Eg. for a 96Mb system, enter
<u>32M</u> here and <u>48M</u> in the 16 - 64MB Extended Memory menu
item.
</p>

<pre>
PCI Devices IRQ assignment
 On board 7870 SCSI controller.......<b>IRQ 11</b>
</pre>

<p>
The actual mapping of the Adaptec 7870 PCI interrupt to IRQ mapping is setup in
the motherboard "BIOS Utility".  Therefore, although the above setting for the
7870 SCSI controller can be set to disabled, it should be set as <b>IRQ 11</b>
here to stop the ECU assigning this IRQ to another card.
</p>

<pre>
 On board Enhanced IDE controller....Disabled
 PCI slot 1..........................<b>IRQ 14</b>
</pre>

<p>
The actual mapping of the DPT 3224 card's PCI interrupt to IRQ mapping is setup
in the motherboard "BIOS Utility".  Therefore, although the above setting for
the PCI slot 1 can be set to disabled, it should be set as <b>IRQ 14</b> here
to stop the ECU assigning this IRQ to another card.
</p>

<pre>
 PCI slot 2..........................Disabled
 PCI slot 3..........................Disabled

Sysem BIOS type......................E, F Segment System used

Peripheral Device Status
 Mouse port..........................Enabled

<p>
To save the ECU definitions, enter <u>&lt;alt&gt;</u> to highlight the top row
of menu items.  Open the <b>System</b> menu by pressing the <u>&lt;down
arrow&gt;</u>.  Slect <b>Exit</b> and then select <b>Save configuration and
exit</b> at the next menu.
</p>

<h2>
 <a name="RTFToC23">The motherboard BIOS Utility</a>
</h2>

<p>
After defining the ECU settings as shown in the previous sub-section reboot the
system and wait for the memory test to run.  Next you will either see the DPT
BIOS run followed by the Adaptec AIC 7870 BIOS or you may not see either of
these which probably means that F10 was pressed to force the system to boot the
ECU floppy.  You are then presented with a blue configuration display in the
top third of the screen.
</p>

<p>
Once whichever of the above occurs after the memory tests, enter
<u>&lt;cntrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt; &lt;esc&gt;</u> to run the motherboard BIOS

<p>
The DPT 3224 card BIOS gives the following type of display for a new system
where the drives attached are not configured as a RAID array.  In the example
below the card has five IBM "Pegasus" DPES-31080 1Gb drives attached and they
are set to SCSI ID's 0,1,2,3,4 respectively

</pre>

<p>
Note the line DPT SCSI BIOS v003.B1 which shows the card's firmware version.
The DPT card MUST NOT have version 3B0 firmware installed as this is known to
corrupt vital DPT specific data on any of the attached hard disk drives.
Version 3B1 (full version name is actually 7A63B1) is the first satisfactory
version to be used.  Contact Apricot Technical Support for the latest version
as it is likely that another release will be preferred in the future.
</p>

<p>
The line above starting Controller: indicates that the card has a single 4Mb
cache simm installed and that its PCI interrupt A line is mapped to the
computer's IRQ 14 line.  If the IRQ is incorrect it should be set correctly in
the computer's BIOS setup (&lt;cntrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;esacpe&gt; during
boot-up) - this setup is described elsewhere in these notes.  The I/O port of
510h is also identified - this is dependent upon the PCI slot used and cannot
be changed, 510h indicates PCI slot 1.

<h2>
 <a name="RTFToC31">Required BTLD floppies</a>
</h2>

<p>
In addition to the SCO distribution floppies and tape, BTLD driver disks are
required for the on-board Adaptec AIC-7870 and the DPT3224.
</p>

<p>
However, do not use the BTLD driver disk for the AIC-7870 that ships in the
FT//ex box as a modified BTLD driver is required that allows installation from
a SCSI tape or CD-ROM connected to the Adaptec onto a SCSI disk connected to
another SCSI adapter.  This is because under SCO Unix 3.2v4.2 the installation
SCSI device must be on the same SCSI bus as the root hard disk.  Once Unix is
installed however, such limitations do not exist - Unix will support the DPT
disks and AIC-7870 SCSI devices.
</p>

<p>
The modified AIC-7870 BTLD floppy image is available from area 39 of Apricot
Insight Online or release 8 or later of the Insight CD.  The filename is
<b>dpt7870.Z</b>.
</p>

<p>
The DPT card's BTLD floppy is created by the DOS based <b>dptmgr.exe</b>
utility used to create the drive array.  Refer to the notes covering the use of
this utility or the DPT SmartRAID User's Manual for a full description of the
creation of such operating system specific floppies.  This <i>DPT OS Setup
diskette</i> as DPT call it, is created by performing an <i>Initial System 
Configuration</i>.  An image of this floppy is also on Insight 10 and in area
39 of Apricot Insight Online as the file <b>DPTBTLD.Z</b>.
</p>

<h3>
 <a name="RTFToC311">Installing</a>
</h3>

<p>
Boot from the SCO N1 floppy as normal and at the Boot: prompt enter:
</p>

<pre>
  <u>link restart Stp=alad(0,2,0) disable=dpt</u>
</pre>

<p>
This will force an installation from a SCSI tape connected to the AIC-7870.
For a CD-ROM installation use the following boot string:
</p>

<pre>
  <u>link restart Srom=alad(0,5,0) disable=dpt</u>
</pre>

<p>
The boot string causes the SCO supplied dpt driver not to be used as this
driver is for earlier DPT cards and is not suitable for the 3224 SmartCache
card.
</p>

<p>
Enter the following when asked what drivers are to be linked in for version
1EB or later of the DPT Manager:
</p>

<pre>
  <u>dptr4 alad</u>
</pre>

<p>
For version 1E9 of the DPT Manager enter:

<pre>
 <u>dptraid alad</u>
</pre>

<p>
Continue with a normal installation.  You will be asked to insert the volumes
that contain these drivers on two separate occasions during the
installation.
</p>

<p>
The installation will default to a SCSI tape on ID 2 connected to the AIC-7870
(alad driver).  If a CD-ROM is being used the installation will say that the
CD-ROM is to be on SCSI ID 5, as mentioned in the Introduction section.
</p>

<p>
Once SCO Unix is installed check the <b>/etc/conf/cf.d/mscsi</b> file for a
SCSI tape entry.  If not present re-create the SCSI tape with the <b>mkdev
tape</b> command in the normal manner.

<p>
The procedure above for <a href="#RTFToC3">Unix 3.2v4.2</a> is not appropriate
for OpenServer 5.  However, it should be referred to and differences here
noted.
</p>

<p>
The DPT Storage Manager software must be at least release 1EB - earlier
releases have no support for OpenServer 5.
</p>

<h2>
 <a name="RTFToC41">Required BTLD floppy</a>
</h2>

<p>
The DPT card's BTLD floppy is created by the DOS based <b>dptmgr.exe</b>
utility used to create the drive array.  An image of this floppy is also on
Insight from Release 10 and in area 39 of Apricot Insight Online as the file
<b>DPTBTLD.Z</b>.  For an OpenServer 5 installation, release 1EB or later
DPT Manager is required.  The menu to create an SCO <i>DPT OS Setup
diskette</i> floppy does not actually list OpenServer 5 as an option with
version 1EB, but selecting the SCO Unix 2.3v4.2 option will create a BTLD
floppy that contains the OpenServer 5 driver.
</p>

<h3>
 <a name="RTFToC411">Installing</a>
</h3>

<p>
Boot from the SCO Boot floppy as normal and at the Boot: prompt enter:
</p>

<pre>
  <u>defbootstr ahslink=dptr5 Stp=alad(0,2,0) disable=dpt</u>
</pre>

<p>
This will force an installation from a SCSI tape connected to the
AIC-7870.  For a CD-ROM installation use the following boot string:
</p>

<pre>
  <u>defbootstr ahslink=dptr5 Srom=alad(0,5,0) disable=dpt</u>
</pre>

<p>
The boot string causes the SCO supplied DPT driver not to be used as
this is for earlier DTP cards and is not suitable for the 3224
SmartCache card.
</p>

<p>
Note that the alad driver exists in the standard OpenServer 5 product.

<p>
From release 1E7 of the DOS based Storage Manager utility <b>dptmgr.exe</b> 
the DPT <i>OS Setup diskette</i> that is created contains the BTLD driver
plus a Unix version of the Storage Manager and an event logger/broadcaster.
From version 1EB there is also support for OpenServer 5.

<h3>
 <a name="RTFToC511">Installation at Unix install time</a>
</h3>

<p>
If the system is installed with a BTLD floppy of at least release 1E7 the
utilities will be placed into the <b>/usr/dpt</b> directory.  One other file
will also be installed, this being the rc startup script
<b>/etc/rc2.d/S33dpt</b>.
</p>

<p>
The files in <b>/usr/dpt</b> are as follows:
</p>

<pre>
S33dpt            dptlog            dptmgrsc.rsc      
dptelog           dptmgr            dptsig            
dptelog.20        dptmgrsc          read.me           
dptelog.def       dptmgrsc.hlp      readme.apps       
dpteng            dptmgrsc.ini      zilmouse.sco      
</pre>

<p>
Of particular interest is the file <b>readme.apps</b> which provides usage and
configuration information.
</p>

<p>
The file <b>dptelog.def</b> configures the error logger utility <b>dptelog</b>.
It is strongly suggested that this file be amended to enable such features as
emailing of failures.  See the sub-section entitled
<a href="#RTFToC513">Suggested modifications</a> below for more detail.
</p>

<h3>
 <a name="RTFToC512">Installation onto a running system</a>
</h3>

<p>
If updating to a later release of the DPT driver, perhaps from the 1E3 release
that did not include a Unix based manager and utility set, use the
<b>installpkg</b> command in the normal way.
<p>

 <a name="RTFToC513">Suggested modifications</a>
</h3>

<p>
The file <b>dptelog.def</b> configures the error logging program
<b>dptelog</b>.  Given below are some entries which may be desirable.  Refer to
the file <b>readme.apps</b> for a full description.
</p>

<pre>
  # TIME is the minutes between checks
  TIME=1
</pre>

<p>
The DPT default for the above setting is that the card is checked for possible
problems every minute.  A longer time could be specified here if desired.  The
default should be satisfactory.
</p>

<pre>
  # SYSLOG= allows you to enable/disable logging the ascii events to a file
  SYSLOG:/usr/adm/messages
</pre>

<p>
The above setting defines that errors are logged to the
<b>/usr/adm/messages</b> file.  This should not be changed.
</p>

<pre>
  # ELOG allows you to enable/disable logging to the binary adapter event file
  ELOG=ON
  # NOTIFY allows you to specify users to be notified
  NOTIFY=root
</pre>

<p>
The DPT default for the above setting is no users defined - commented
out.
</p>

<pre>
  # NOTIFY=D: allows you to specify a device to be notified to
  NOTIFY=D:/dev/console
  # MAIL will email the events to any currently set up users
  MAIL
</pre>

<p>
The DPT default for the above setting is no mail - commented out.
</p>

<pre>
  # NOCLEAR will not clear the adapter data so each scan will get the same data
  #NOCLEAR
  # NOWAIT will scan the system once and exit
  #NOWAIT
</pre>

 <a name="RTFToC52">Using the utilities</a>
</h2>

<p>
The only utility that should be needed from the command line is the Unix
version of the Storage Manager.  This command is <b>/usr/dpt/dptmgr</b>.  It
can support the use of a mouse and if this is required use the Unix
<b>mkdev mouse</b> utility to configure a mouse.  However, it is quite usable
without a mouse and works in a similar manner to the DOS Storage Manager
<b>dptmgr.exe</b>.  This command is actually a script that uses
<b>/usr/dtp/usemouse</b> to establish if a mouse is attached, and then runs
one or two manager binaries dependent upon whether there is a mouse or not.
There is a slight difference to the DOS version however; the &lt;alt&gt; key
is not used with other keys as a short-cut to an option.  Instead the same
character is preceeded with an &lt;escape&gt;, so to Switch View for example
use the key sequence:
</p>

<pre>
  <u>&lt;escape&gt;v</u>
</pre>

<p>
<u>Note</u> it is possible that the command <b>/usr/dpt/dptmgr</b>
mistakenly assumes that there is a mouse attached when these is not.  In
this case use the command <b>/usr/dpt/dptmgrscr</b> to run the manager.
This is the keyboard-only binary that the <b>/usr/dpt/dptmgr</b> script
should invoke.
</p>

<p>
For a full descripion of the Storage Manager's functions and options refer to
the notes accompanying the hardware and RAID array setup and the DPT SmartRAID
User's Manual.
</p>

<p>
A couple of minor bugs have been seen so far:
</p>

<ol>
 <li>
 <p>
  If <b>dptmgr</b> is running when a drive fails, it fails to identify
  the model type details when the replacement drive is re-installed.  You
  cannot view the failed or rebuilding drive.  To overcome this, exit
  Storage Manager and run it again.
 </p>
 <li>
 <p>
  The error logger seems to generate spurious <i>High temporature
  detected</i> and <i>Normal temporature restored</i> error messages.  The
  card is fitted with a temporature sensor and is also able to receive
  such messages from an attached SmartRAID Storage Cabinet which is a 
  proprietary DPT piece of hardware not used by Apricot.
 </p>
</ol>

 <a name="RTFToC6">Emergency floppies</a>
</h1>

<p>
There is a potential risk of an inexperienced user damaging the data held on
the array by using the DPT utilities.  For this reason alone it is desirable to
make an emergency boot set of floppies and a full root filesystem backup using
<b>cpio(C)</b>.  With the emergency floppies and the <b>cpio(C)</b> backup tape
the root filesystem can be restored onto a re-created <i>logical drive</i>.
</p>

<h2>
 <a name="RTFToC61">Related documentation</a>
</h2>

<p>
Refer to Info Guide <a href="unx003.htm">UNX003</a> for guidence on the
subject of creation of emergency floppies, backing up, and restoring such
tapes onto blank (low level formatted) root disks.  The Info Guide covers
such details as making a hard disk bootable, creating the Unix partition,
creating the root filesystem and restoring the backup tape onto the
filesystem.  By using this method there is no need to carry out a Unix
installation from the SCO media prior to restoration of the backup tape.
