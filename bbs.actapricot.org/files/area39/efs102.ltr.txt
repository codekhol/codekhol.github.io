	1.  Preface
    
	These release and installation notes introduce the scoterm terminal
	emulator, describe the procedure for installing it, and discuss
	options for configuring it to run under SCO(r) Open DesktopTM or SCO
	Xsight(r), SCO's X window systems. You should read these notes prior
	to installing scoterm.
    
	scoterm provides full ANSI compatibility for character-based programs
	that cannot use the X Window SystemTM directly. scoterm provides the
	following improvements over xterm, the existing terminal emulator for
	X:
    
	    +   full ANSI features available for all applications
    
	    +   color support
    
	    +   mouse support for applications written for X and also for
		older applications
    
	    +   support for resizing of applications running within the
		scoterm window

	The scoterm documentation consists of these release and installation
	notes, plus an on-line manual page.  For your convenience, a printed
	copy of the manual page accompanies these notes.
    
	2.  Installing scoterm
    
	If you plan to run scoterm on an SCO console display, you must install
	and configure SCO Open Desktop or SCO Xsight on your system first.  If
	you plan to run scoterm only on an X window display terminal, you need
	not install Open Desktop or Xsight.
    
	2.1  Installing scoterm on a UNIX System
    
	The scoterm installation procedure is identical under all versions of
	the UNIX system listed in the previous section.  The installation pro-
	cedure relinks the UNIX kernel, which means that you must reboot the
	operating system near the end of the procedure.  Thus you must get all
	other users off the system before you begin.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	11 September 1990/1.0.0         - 2  -  The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	When you are ready, follow these steps to install scoterm:
    
	1.   Log in as root.  When the root prompt (#) appears, type the fol-
	     lowing command:
    
		  custom
    
	     Press <Return>.  The custom menu appears.
    
	2.   The Install selection is highlighted.  Press <Return> to choose
	     Install.  The Install menu appears.  Press <Return> to select the
	     option A New Product, and then press <Return> again to select
	     Entire Product.
    
	3.   The program now asks you to insert Distribution Floppy Volume 1.
	     Insert the scoterm distribution diskette in floppy drive 0 and
	     press <Return>.
    
	4.   The screen displays the messages Installing custom data files and
	     Creating file lists.  Then the program asks you to insert the
	     diskette SCO SCOterm for X Window Systems Floppy Volume 1.  You
	     already inserted this diskette, so just press <Return> again.
    
	5.   The screen displays the following messages while the installation
	     continues:
    
		  Extracting files...
    
		  Executing SCO SCOterm for X Window Systems
		  Init Script
		  SCOterm Enhanced ANSI Console Emulator
    
		  Updating system configuration...
		  Creating new nodes...
    
    
	     If scoterm was installed on this system before, you may also see
	     the message: Mouse already configured for SCOterm.
    
	6.   You must now relink the UNIX system kernel.  The installation
	     program asks if you want to do this.  Answer y and press
	     <Return>.  A message informs you that the kernel is being
	     rebuilt.  This process takes a few minutes.
    
	7.   After the kernel is rebuilt, you are asked if you want this ker-

	Release and Installation Notes
    
    
    
	     nel to boot by default.  Type y and press <Return>.
    
	8.   You now see these messages:
    
		  Backing up /unix to /unix.old.
		  Installing new /unix.
    
		  The kernel environment includes device
		  node files and /etc/inittab.
		  The new kernel may require changes to
		  /etc/inittab or device nodes.
    
	     After these messages appear, you are asked if you want the kernel
	     environment rebuilt.  Type y and press <Return>.
    
	9.   You now see a message stating that the kernel has been success-
	     fully installed or rebuilt, followed by a message stating that
	     the kernel environment is being set up.  Finally, the installa-
	     tion program prompts you to press any key to continue.  Press a
	     key.
    
	10.  You see the message Checking file permissions...  and then the
	     installation program returns you to the custom menu.  Remove the
	     distribution diskette from the floppy drive.  Now exit custom by
	     highlighting the menu's Quit option and pressing <Return>.
	     Select Yes to leave custom.
    
	11.  You must now reboot the system.  To do this, shut down the
	     operating system by entering this command at the root prompt:
    
		  /etc/shutdown -g0 -y
    
	     In a few moments the screen displays a message telling you that
	     the system is shut down.  Now press any key to reboot your sys-
	     tem.
    
	2.2  Installing scoterm on a XENIX System
    
	To install scoterm under SCO XENIX V/386 Release 2.3.2, you need not
	relink the kernel or reboot the operating system as is required under
	UNIX systems.
    
	Follow this procedure to install scoterm:
    
	1.   Log in to the system as root.
    
	2.   At the root prompt (#), type custom and press  <Return>.  The
	     initial custom menu then appears.
    
	3.   Choose the Add a Supported Product option.   The program now
	     prompts you to enter distribution volume 1.  Insert the scoterm
    
    
    
    
    
    
	11 September 1990/1.0.0         - 4  -  The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	     distribution diskette in floppy drive 0 and press <Return>.
    
	4.   A new menu appears. Choose the Install One or More Packages
	     option.
    
	5.   A list of available packages to install now appears on the
	     screen.  Enter ALL and press <Return>.
    
	6.   The program now asks you to insert the diskette SCO SCOterm for X
	     Window Systems Volume 1.  You have already done this, so just
	     press <Return> again.
    
	7.   The screen displays the following messages while the installation
	     continues:
    
		  Extracting files...
    
		  SCOterm Enhanced ANSI Console Emulator
		  Checking file permissions..
    
	8.   When the installation process finishes, you return to custom.
	     Press q to exit the custom menu.
    
    
	3.  Configuring scoterm for Open Desktop or Xsight
    
	Once you install scoterm, you can run it by typing scoterm from within
	an xterm window.  But if you want to use it as the default terminal
	emulator for Xsight or Open Desktop, you must change certain confi-
	guration files that these programs use.  This section tells how.
    
	3.1  Updating the .startxrc Files
    
	When you start Xsight or Open Desktop, your software may be configured
	to start the xterm client automatically.  If you would like to start
	the scoterm client automatically instead, you must modify either
	/usr/lib/X11/sys.startxrc or the .startxrc file in your home direc-
	tory.
    
	The file /usr/lib/X11/sys.startxrc specifies which X clients should
	start automatically when you call up Xsight or Open Desktop.  This
	file provides the default instructions for all users.  Individual
	users can override the default instructions by putting customized
	.startxrc files in their home directories.
    
	To have scoterm start automatically, edit /usr/lib/X11/sys.startxrc
	and replace the command xterm with the command scoterm.  When you have
	done this, scoterm starts automatically for all users except the ones
	who have customized .startxrc files.  They must modify their .startxrc
	files to include scoterm.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	11 September 1990/1.0.0         - 5  -  The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc.
    
    
    
    
	Release and Installation Notes
    
    
    
	By the same token, if you do not modify /usr/lib/X11/sys.startxrc to
	include scoterm, individual users who want scoterm to start automati-
	cally can add it to their personal .startxrc files.
    
	3.2  Adding scoterm to the Root Menu
    
	This section tells you how to substitute scoterm for xterm on the Root
	menu.  The Root menu appears when you press the left mouse button in
	the background area around the Desktop window.  This area is called
	the Root window under Open Desktop, and it is called the Workspace
	under Xsight.
    
	Under Open Desktop Version 1.1 and Xsight Version 2.2, the Root menu
	option that calls xterm is called New Window.  On Open Desktop Version
	1.0's Root menu, the option is simply called xterm.
    
	If you want to substitute scoterm for xterm on the Root menu, you must
	modify the /usr/lib/X11/system.mwmrc file.  This adds scoterm to the
	default Root menu configuration for all users.
    
	Some users may have a personal .mwmrc file in their home directories
	that overrides the default settings in  system.mwmrc. If you have such
	a file, you must modify it as well.   (If you choose not to change the
	system-wide default configuration for the Root menu, other users can
	change the menu for themselves by modifying their own .mwmrc files.)
    
	To add scoterm to the Root menu, edit the file
	/usr/lib/X11/system.mwmrc (or the .mwmrc file on your home directory)
	and search for the string Menu RootMenu.  You should find a section of
	code that looks like this:
    
		Menu RootMenu
		{
			"Root Menu"             f.title
			"Clients"       _C      f.menu ClientsMenu
			"New Window"    _N      f.exec "xterm -sb  &"
			"Shuffle Up"    _U      f.circle_up
			"Shuffle Down"  _D      f.circle_down
			"Refresh"       _R      f.refresh
			no-label                f.separator
			"Restart"               f.restart
		}
    
	This section sets the menu selections for Xsight's Root menu.  To
	modify it to offer scoterm instead of xterm, change the line for the
	xterm option as follows:
    
			"New Window"    _N      f.exec "scoterm -sb  &"
    
	Follow the same procedure to change the Root menu under Open Desktop
	Version 1.0.  The line that you have to change may look slightly
    
    
    
    
    
    
	11 September 1990/1.0.0         - 6  -  The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	different, however:
    
			"xterm"    _x     f.exec "xterm -sb  &"
    
	Edit it to look like this:
    
			"SCOterm"  _S     f.exec "scoterm -sb  &"
    
	The Root menu now has a scoterm option instead of an xterm option.
    
	3.3  Linking scoterm to the UNIX Icon
    
	Your default Open Desktop or Xsight desktop window includes a UNIX
	icon that calls xterm.  If you wish, you can make the icon call
	scoterm instead.
    
	To do this, you must modify the file
	/usr/lib/X11/xdt/defaultDesktop/UNIX.  This file is a short shell
	script that starts the xterm program every time you double-click on
	the UNIX icon.  Edit the file and change every occurrence of the word
	``xterm'' to ``scoterm''.  Now the UNIX icon calls up scoterm instead
	of xterm.
    
	4.  Configuring scoterm for Color
    
	You can configure scoterm to use colors or to display a monochrome
	window.  If you want color, you can configure scoterm to use either
	ANSI colors or the X default color map.
    
	scoterm's ANSI color set actually is a superset of the ANSI colors.
	It features the eight standard colors, plus a lighter version of each
	color.  Besides the normal ANSI ``blue,'' ``red,'' and ``white,'' for
	example, scoterm supports ``lt_blue,'' ``lt_red,'' and ``hi_white.''
    
	4.1  Using the X Default Color Map
    
	By default, scoterm displays its window in color and uses the X
	default color map.  The color map does not support the full range of
	ANSI colors.  Instead, scoterm draws from this map the colors that are
	the closest approximation to the ANSI colors.  If there is no approxi-
	mate match, scoterm uses white.
    
	scoterm uses the X default color map when the
	Scoterm*useDefaultColormapOnly resource is set to ``true,'' and the
	Scoterm*monochrome resource is set to ``false.''
    
	4.2  Using ANSI Colors
    
	scoterm has a color map of its own that supports full ANSI colors.  If
	you want true ANSI colors, add the option -cmap to the scoterm com-
	mand.
    
    
    
    
    
    
	11 September 1990/1.0.0         - 7  -  The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc.
    
    
    
    
	Release and Installation Notes
    
    
    
	scoterm also uses the ANSI color map when the
	Scoterm*useDefaultColormapOnly and Scoterm*monochrome resources are
	both set to ``false.''
    
	4.2.1  ANSI Color Resources
    
	scoterm's ANSI color map is defined in
	/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Scoterm.  This file includes a resource for
	each color.  In the file, the resources have names like Ansi.blue,
	Ansi.red, and so on.  Each resource is assigned the value of the color
	it calls.  If you want, however, you can change the color value of a
	resource to any other color that your server supports.  You can find
	the color values that Xsight and Open Desktop support for the system
	console in the file /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt.
    
	If you add any of the color resources from /usr/lib/X11/app-
	defaults/Scoterm to your personal .Xdefaults in your home directory,
	you must add the prefix Scoterm* to each resource and use a lower-case
	``a'' in ``ansi:'' Scoterm*ansi.red, Scoterm*ansi.blue, and so on.
    
	4.2.2  Possible Color Shifts under the scoterm Color Map
    
	If you use scoterm's ANSI color map, you may notice sudden shifts in
	window color when you change focus between scoterm windows and other
	windows.  This can happen when the active window imposes its own color
	map on the other windows.  If the color maps used by the various win-
	dows are sufficiently different, noticeable color shifts appear as you
	shift from window to window.
    
	If you want to avoid this color shift, you have two choices.  First,
	you can do without the -cmap option and use the X default color map
	instead of the ANSI colors.  Second, you can continue using scoterm's
	ANSI color map, but change the color values assigned to each color
	resource so that they do not conflict with the other windows' color
	maps.
    
	4.3  Monochrome Operation
    
	If you are not interested in color, you can configure scoterm not to
	use color.  Simply add the option -mono to the scoterm command.
    
	scoterm also displays a monochrome window when the Scoterm*monochrome
	resource is set to ``true.''
    
	4.4  Using setcolor
    
	Use the setcolor utility to reset the foreground and background colors
	in the scoterm window.  If you enter the setcolor command without any
	options, the command displays setcolor usage information and resets
	the window's colors to the default foreground color and default back-
	ground color.   To set the window to the default colors without

	displaying usage information, enter setcolor -n.
    
	When you first receive scoterm, it uses white and black as the default
	foreground and background colors, respectively.  You can change the
	default colors if you want, but sometimes with unexpected results.
	See the ``Limitations'' section later in this document for details.
    
	5.  Running Common Applications Under scoterm
    
	The following sections show how to make Microsoft Word(r) and SCO Pro-
	fessional work properly under scoterm.
    
	5.1  Running SCO Professional 2.0 under scoterm
    
	SCO Professional(r) Version 2.0 was optimized to run under xterm. If
	you are going to run SCO Professional 2.0 in a scoterm window, enter
	the term type xterm-ac instead of the usual term type of ansi.
    
	Because xterm-ac is a new terminal type, you must establish it in your
	operating system before you can use it.  To do so, you create a sub-
	directory called xterm-ac in the directory /usr/lib/sco/tcap, and
	grant read and execute permission for the new directory to all users.
	Then you copy all the files in the /usr/lib/sco/tcap/ansi directory
	into the new subdirectory.  You must also copy the file
	/usr/lib/sco/tcap/xterm/graph.pro into the xterm-ac subdirectory.
    
	If you do not know how to perform the operations described in the pre-
	vious paragraph, just enter the following commands in the order that
	they appear in:
    
	1.   Enter this command to move to the tcap directory
    
		  cd /usr/lib/sco/tcap
    
	2.   Enter this command to make the xterm-ac subdirectory:
    
		  mkdir xterm-ac
    
	3.   Enter this command to grant read and execute privileges on the
	     new directory to all users:
    
		  chmod a+rx xterm-ac
    
	4.   Enter this command to copy the contents of the ansi subdirectory
	     into the xterm-ac subdirectory:
    
		  cp ansi/* xterm-ac

	5.   Enter this command to copy the graph.pro file from the xterm sub-
	     directory into the xterm-ac subdirectory.
    
		  cp xterm/graph.pro xterm-ac
    
    
	Before actually running SCO Professional Version 2.0, you must also
	make minor changes to the last six lines of the shell scripts
	/usr/bin/pro and /usr/bin/procalc.  The files are nearly identical.
    
	The last six lines of /usr/bin/pro look like this:
    
	if [ $TERM = "xterm" ]
	then
	   exec xterm -n "ProMgr" -T "SCOProfessionalManager" -e $PROLIB/$MGR $*
	else
	   exec $PROLIB/$MGR $*
	fi
    
	Replace those lines with the following:
    
	if [ $WINDOWID ]
	then
	   if [ -f /usr/bin/X11/scoterm ]
	   then
	      execscoterm-n"ProMgr"-T"SCOProfessionalManager"-tnxterm-ac \
			  -e$PROLIB/$MGR$*
	   else
	      execxterm-n"ProMgr"-T"SCOProfessional"-tnxterm-e$PROLIB/$MGR$*
	   fi
	else
	   exec $PROLIB/$MGR $*
	fi
    
	As mentioned above, the last six lines of /usr/bin/procalc are nearly
	identical to the last six in /usr/bin/pro.  Replace them with the
	following:
    
	if [ $WINDOWID ]
	then
	   if [ -f/usr/bin/X11/scoterm ]
	   then
	      execscoterm-n"SCOPro"-T"SCOProfessional"-tnxterm-ac-e$PROLIB/$CALC$*
	   else
	      execxterm-n"SCOPro"-T"SCOProfessional"-tnxterm-e$PROLIB/$CALC$*
	   fi
	else
	   exec $PROLIB/$CALC $*
	fi

	5.2  Running Microsoft Word under scoterm
    
	Under certain circumstances, Microsoft Word's cursor becomes invisible
	under scoterm.  The circumstances behind this problem are very
	specific, and you can eliminate them in several different ways.
    
	scoterm has a TERM type of ``ansi'' and displays a steady, non-
	blinking cursor by default.  Word, however, expects to find a blinking
	cursor in an ANSI environment.   Word reacts to scoterm's steady cur-
	sor by giving its text cursor the same color as the window's back-
	ground color: a blue cursor on a blue background, for example.
    
	You can solve this problem by configuring scoterm to display a blink-
	ing cursor, or by using the setcolor command to change the colors that
	scoterm uses for reverse video.
    
	5.2.1  Setting a Blinking Cursor
    
	You can add a blinking cursor to scoterm in several different ways:
    
	    +   Use the -blink option when invoking scoterm from another
		scoterm or xterm window.  The command is:
    
		     scoterm -blink &
    
	    +   Set the Scoterm*blink resource to ``true.''  This means that
		the cursor will blink in every scoterm window that you create.
		You can set this resource either in the .Xdefaults file in
		your home directory, which affects only you, or in the
		/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Scoterm file, which sets the default
		scoterm configuration for all users.
    
	    +   Edit your .mwmrc file or the file /usr/lib/X11/system.mwmrc so
		that it invokes scoterm with the -blink option, as described
		above.  This gives blinking cursors to scoterm sessions
		invoked from the Root menu, but not to scoterm sessions
		started by other means.   Change the line that invokes scoterm
		to look something like this:
    
		      "New Window"    _N      f.exec "scoterm -sb -blink &"
    
		If you make the change to your own .mwmrc file, it affects
		only you; but if you make the change to the
		/usr/lib/X11/system.mwmrc, it becomes the default for all
		users.

	5.2.2  Changing the Reverse Video Colors
    
	If you do not want a blinking cursor, you can make Word's cursor visi-
	ble under scoterm by changing the scoterm window's reverse video fore-
	ground color to be different than the current foreground color.  To do
	this, use the command setcolor -r followed by the new reverse video
	foreground and background colors.  For example, enter the command
	setcolor -r magenta black in a scoterm window to see a magenta-colored
	text cursor when you run Word in that window.
    
	6.  Limitations
    
	Version 1.0.0 of scoterm contains several limitations.  The following
	sections describe them.
    
	6.1  No Mouse Support for Applications under XENIX
    
	Under XENIX, applications cannot control the mouse from within a
	scoterm window.  The application's mouse commands, if any, do not
	work.  You can use the mouse in the window, but only to give commands
	to scoterm itself:  cut text, paste text, call up a scoterm menu,
	select a menu option.
    
	6.2  Modifying the Default Foreground and Background Colors
    
	Users can change scoterm's default foreground and background colors by
	redefining the Scoterm*foreground and Scoterm*background resources in
	their personal .Xdefaults files, or by using the -fg and -bg command-
	line options with the scoterm command.  If they do this, however, they
	can no longer change the screen colors to black or white through
	setcolor.
    
	scoterm's default window colors are white for the foreground (defined
	in Scoterm*foreground) and black for the background (defined in
	Scoterm*background). These two resources also define the colors white
	and black for scoterm under the setcolor command.  So if you change
	the default foreground and background colors from white and black, you
	no longer have access to those two colors through setcolor.  The color
	samples for white and black in the setcolor display instead show the
	new default foreground and background colors.
    
	6.3  Problems When Quitting scoterm Abnormally
    
	You will sometimes experience problems if you leave a scoterm window
	open while quitting  Xsight or Open Desktop.  Under such conditions,
	one or more scoterm processes may occasionally remain running in the
	background.
    
	If this has happened, the error message ``scoterm: no available ptys''
	appears when you try to start another scoterm session.  Thus, you
    
    
    
    
    
    
	11 September 1990/1.0.0        - 12  -  The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
	cannot run scoterm again until you kill the processes.
    
	(Note that the error message may also appear if you try to open a
	scoterm window when several other scoterm or xterm windows are already
	open.  In that case, close the other windows and try again to start a
	new scoterm session.  If you can, then you simply had too many termi-
	nal emulators going at once.)
    
	To avoid leaving scoterm processes running, just close each scoterm
	window before quitting the window manager.  This is standard procedure
	for quitting a program under a window manager.  But when the problem
	does occur, solve it by following this procedure:
    
	1.   Exit from Xsight or Open Desktop.
    
	2.   Get a list of the processes that are still running under your
	     account. To do this, enter the command ps -fu username, where
	     username is your user ID.
    
	3.   Check the output from the ps command for scoterm processes.  Kill
	     each scoterm process by entering the command kill -9 PID, where
	     PID is the process ID of the process you are killing.
    
	4.   After you kill all scoterm processes, restart Xsight or Open
	     Desktop and try scoterm again.
    
	This situation is caused by a problem in the UNIX streams driver,
	which will be fixed in a future release of the UNIX system.
    
	6.4  Using Mapkey and Mapstr
    
	If you use the mapkey or mapstr commands under scoterm, the new key
	assignments do not take effect until you select the Do Full Reset
	option from scoterm's ansiMenu.
    
	6.5  Mapstr -d option is not Supported
    
	scoterm does not support the -d option to the mapstr command.
    
	6.6  Scrollbar Disables Window Position Coordinates
    
	If you configure scoterm to display a scrollbar in its window at
	startup time, scoterm ignores any specific position coordinates you
	specified for the window through the geometry resource.  To work
	around this, do not specify a scrollbar when starting scoterm.
	Instead, wait until the window appears, and then add a scrollbar by
	choosing Enable Scrollbar from scoterm's ansiMenu.

	Release and Installation Notes
    
    
    
	6.7  Limited International Keyboard Support
    
	scoterm's support of the mapkey (M) function does not include interna-
	tional keyboard support.  The current SCO X server does not support
	international keyboards, so scoterm cannot do so either.
    
	The next release of Xsight will support international keyboards.  In
	the meantime, you may use mapkey under scoterm only to map the modi-
	fied key values of a given configuration.  You cannot alter the base
	character assigned to a key, but you can change the character assigned
	to that key when it is pressed in conjunction with the <Ctrl> ,
	<Shift>, or <Alt> keys.
    
	For example, you can edit the default /usr/lib/keyboard/keys file to
	modify the ``Ctrl,'' ``Shift,'' and ``Alt'' states of the character
	``s,'' but you cannot change the value of the base character ``s''
	itself.
    
	After you edit the keys file, you incorporate the changes into scoterm
	by giving the command:
    
	   mapkey /usr/libkeyboard/keys < /dev/console
