Irwin Tape Driver Installation Procedure
========================================
        
Place the Irwin driver diskette (SLS unx222) in your floppy drive and type the 
following at a root prompt:

     cd /
     /etc/custom
        
From the custom menu pick:

     Install -> A New Product -> Entire Product -> Continue
        
Next, you will see the messages:
        
     Installing custom data files.
     Creating file list.
     Extracting files.
     Executing Unix Irwin Tape Driver Init Script.












Next, you will see the message:

     The Irwin Tape Driver is configured.
     You must relink the kernel and reboot the system in order to make the
     driver active.

     Do you want to Re-Link the Kernel now (y/n) 
        
The Irwin tape driver has now been extracted.  To actually link the driver into
your SCO UNIX System V/386 kernel, answer "y" and then enter <Return>.
        
Next you will see:
        
     The UNIX Operating System will now be rebuilt.
     This will take a few minutes. Please wait.
          
     Root for this system build is /. 
        
After a few minutes you will see the following message:
           
     The UNIX Kernel has been rebuilt.

You will then be asked:
        
     Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n)
     Again, answer "y" and then enter <Return>.
        
The next system message you will see is:
             
     Backing up /unix to unix.old
     Installing new /unix

     The kernel environment includes device node files and /etc/inittab.
     The new kernel may require changes to /etc/inittab or device nodes.
        
You will then be asked:

     Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)

Again, answer "y" and then enter <Return>.        

The next system message you will see is:

     Setting up new kernel environment

Next you will be taken back to Custom with the prompt:

     Press any key to continue

After pressing any key, you may quit Custom.
 
You should now create an emergency Boot/Root floppy with the appropriate tape
device on it.  This is vital in the case of a system crash where you need to
boot from your emergency Boot/Root floppy and restore data from your backup
tape.
        











To do this at the prompt, type:
             
     mkdev fd

At the menu, pick the appropriate option for the type of floppy you are using.

NOTE: You cannot use 48tpi.
        
At the next menu, pick the option for:
        
     Bootable only  
        
followed by the option for:
        
     Root filesystem only
        
This is because 96ds15 and 135ds9 floppies cannot fit the amount of data needed
for a single Root/Boot floppy.  In either case, you will be asked:
        
     Would you like to format the floppy first? (y/n)
        
In case your floppy is unformatted.  When this process is complete, remove
the floppy from the drive and store it in a safe place.

In the Event of a system crash
==============================
        
The emergency Boot/Root floppy that has been prepared for you contains all you
will need to boot up and issue a restore command after a system crash.  When 
you boot up using your emergency floppy, you will be put in System Maintenance
mode at a root prompt.  You can then restore your backup using the following 
two commands:
        
     /etc/mcdaemon <Return>
     /bin/restore rf /dev/rctmini /dev/hd0root <Return>

The "/etc/mcdaemon" command starts a daemon process which is necessary to the
operation of the Irwin tape drive.  When you boot up from the hard disk this
daemon is automatically started for you, but when you boot up from your Boot/
Root floppy, you need to issue the "/etc/mcdaemon" command before your restore
command.  The restore command itself restores a root filesystem backup from the
Irwin tape device.  This command is to be used for tape backups made using the
"backup", or "sysadmin" utilities.

The "mcart" Utility
===================
        
The new Irwin utility "/bin/mcart" has also been added to your system.  It
enables you to perform a number a useful functions on your Irwin tape drive.
They are summarized below:
        
     h        - This is a help command which allows you to view a list of
                available "mcart" commands.
        
     drive    - This command provides information about drive type, controller
                type and unit select.
        
     info     - This command provides information about cartridge state, format
                and write protect slider position.
        





     capacity - This command shows the total cartridge capacity in 512 byte  
                blocks after formatting.
        
     kapacity - This command shows the total cartridge capacity in 1024 byte
                blocks after formatting.
        
     format   - This command enables you to prepare unformatted tape cartridges
                for use with your Irwin tape drive.  If you are using Accutrak
                pre-formatted tape cartridges, you will not need to use this
                command. (SEE NOTE BELOW)
        
                To use the "format" command, you need to make sure you are 
                using either brand new, unformatted tapes, or bulk 
                (magnetically) erased tapes.  
        
     rewind   - This command is used to rewind a tape after a backup or
                restore has been interrupted.  Normally, the tape is
                rewound automatically.

     reten    - This command is used to align a tape that has not been used
                for a long time, or has been exposed to temperature extremes.
        
The command syntax is:
        
     mcart command
        
For example, using the "rewind" option, the command would be:
        
     mcart rewind
        
Notes
=====
    
(1) Due to problems that arise while formatting tapes, SCO Technical Support 
    is not able to fully support the "format" option. Keeping this in mind,
    for data integrity reasons, SCO highly recommends that pre-formatted tapes
    are used with Irwin tape drives. The format option is provided for use
    at your own risk!

(2) The device you write to should be "/dev/rctmini". This device needs
    to be specified regardless of whether you are writing to the drive
    with "tar", "backup", "cpio", or some other utility.
        
(3) Also, regardless of which utility you use to write to the drive, you
    MUST specify a blocking factor.  The recommended blocking factor is "20".

(4) If you choose to format your own tapes, remember that you 
    MUST BULK ERASE the tape to be formatted. If you do not bulk 
    erase your tape, you will not be able to format it. Please remember 
    that the format option is *not* fully supported by SCO. It is provided
    for use at your own risk!
        
(5) While installing your hardware, please refer to the hardware guide
    shipped with your Irwin tape backup unit. If you have questions
    regarding the installation of your Irwin hardware, contact Irwin
    Technical Support.
        











If you have any further questions please contact your supplier.

Wait for Index
==============

A condition exists in some Micro Channel computers which causes errors reading
the first sector of each tape block.  Included are the IBM PS2 models 50, 60,
and 80, and the Olivetti P-500.

If the following symptoms are experienced, after installing the MC driver in
certain Micro Channel machines, the wait-for-index algorithm may need to be
enabled:

     o    On the first backup this message is seen:

          <mc> tape write error: Defect list has unrecoverable error

     o    If "mcart format" gives the error:

          Formatting failed: Block 0 medium error :
          phase: CERTIFICATION,  track:  0,  cylinder:  0

     o    Extremely poor performance is experienced while 
          listing the content of or restoring a previously 
          written tape.

     To enable wait-for-index at the root prompt, the 
     following commands may be used:

          # echo iropt=I >> /etc/default/mcconfig
          # reboot

Using the wait-for-index algorithm has the following drawback:

All user system task time processing is stopped until index polling is
complete.  This means the user will see sluggish system performance at certain
times.  Typically this means a 3 or 4 second dead period at tape track switch
time.  This may prove unacceptable in certain installations.

Error Messages
==============

Below is a list of the most common error messages included in the Irwin tape
driver.

Block not found
===============

IE_BLKNOTFND(5)

A block not found error occurs when the driver cannot locate a physical tape
block during a read or write operation.

Insure the tape head is clean (see the tape drive hardware manual for cleaning
instructions).











When this message is displayed during a data restore operation, try
retensioning the tape, then repeat the restore operation.  If this fails, try
restoring the data using a different tape drive.

When this message is displayed during data backup operation, try another tape.
If your backup is successful on another tape, discard or bulk erase and
reformat the original tape.

Data CRC error
=============

IE_CRC(12)

ID CRC error
============

IE_IDCRC(13)

An "ID CRC error", or "Data CRC error" message is displayed during a tape read
operation when a tape block cannot be recovered by ECC.  If this message
appears, retension the tape and try again.  If this fails, the data might be
recovered by using a different tape drive.  Causes of persistent CRC errors
are: poor quality tapes, worn tape head, a defect in the drive's record
circuitry, or an incompatible or otherwise defective data separator circuit on
the controller.  CRC errors might be stopped by using new tapes, or installing
a data compensator circuit on the drive.

Record not found
================

IE_RECNOTFND(14)

A "Record not found" error occurs when some sector within a tape block cannot
be located.  This error typically occurs on a during a tape read operation
when there are too many erroneous sectors to recover data using ECC.  (See
Data CRC Error).

Drive not found
===============

IE_DRVNOTFND(23)

When /etc/mcdaemon is run (usually by an "rc" script) for the first time after
system boot, a drive searching algorithm is executed by the driver.  If this
algorithm fails to detect the presence of a tape drive, "<mc> Drive not found"
is displayed.  Subsequently, the same message is displayed on any read or
write access to an opened MC device file for which no drive is present.  When
this message appears, hardware should be checked.















Servo failure
=============

IE_SERVO(24)

"Servo failure" is a tape formatting error message.  The servo writing
function is a part of the tape drive's firmware.  The driver issues a command
to the drive to servo write and awaits tape drive completion status.  Usually
the drive's LED will be flashing on servo writing failure.  Try bulk erasing
the cartridge and restart the format.  If this fails, try another cartridge.

Insufficient memory
===================

IE_NOMEM(42)

"Insufficient memory" messages are given when the driver fails to allocate at
least three tape block buffers.  Sufficient memory may be available when
single user mode is entered immediately after system boot.  Usually adding
memory to the system will stop this message.

Block 0 missing servo header                 IE_SERVOBLK0(43)
Too many sequential missing servo headers    IE_SERVOSEQ(44)
Too many missing servo headers on track      IE_SERVOTRK(45)
Too many missing servo headers               IE_SERVOTOT(46)
Too many sequential bad blocks               IE_CYLSEQ(47)
Too many bad blocks on a track               IE_CYLTRK(48)
Too many bad blocks                          IE_CYLTOT(49)

These messages occur during formatting.  When formatting fails for one of
these reasons, try bulk erasing the cartridge and reformatting.  If this
fails, try another cartridge.

Block 0 medium error
====================

IE_BLK0DEFECT(52)

A "Block 0 medium error" results when, during tape state determination, the
first tape block has a medium error which is not recoverable by either
redundant correction or ECC.  Normally the cartridge should be reformatted or
discarded.  If the cartridge has a backup on it, try using a different drive
to read the tape.

If this message persists for multiple cartridges, the tape drive's read
circuitry may be out of adjustment, or there may be an incompatibility between
the floppy controller's data separator circuit and the tape drive.  When
running on a Micro Channel based machine the problem may be overcome.  (See
section od Wait for Index in this documentation.)

Defect list has unrecoverable error
===================================

IE_DLISTDEFECT(54)

This message is displayed when both copies of the relocation table (kept in
the second and third good tape blocks) have unrecoverable medium errors or are
otherwise corrupt.









When this message is displayed on the first backup after drive installation in
a Micro Channel machine, the wait-for-index patch may be needed.

Defect list corrupt
===================

IE_DLISTCORRUPT(55)

This message is displayed if an error is found in the primary defect list kept
in block 0.  Reformat the tape.

Daemon not started
==================

IE_NODAEMON(67)

The tape driver uses a single daemon process to encode ECC during tape write
operations and recover data with ECC during tape reads.  When the "Daemon not
started" message occurs, execute /etc/mcdaemon and retry the tape operation.

If you have any further questions please contact your supplier.
