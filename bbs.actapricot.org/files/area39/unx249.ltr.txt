Dear SCO Customer,

Enclosed is Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx249c, the SCO UNIX System V/386 
Printer Supplement.  Please read this entire letter before beginning the 
update in order to insure proper configuration of your particular system.

The SCO UNIX System V/386 Printer Supplement contains various modifications for
the SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System, SCO UNIX System V/386
Release 3.2 Operating System Version 2.0, SCO Open Desktop Release 1.0 and 1.1. The release of the operating system may be obtained by typing one of the 
following commands (note that the '#' character is the super-user's shell 
prompt; do not type it):

	# swconfig
or
        # grep rel= /etc/perms/inst

If you use the "swconfig" command, examine the set entry "The Operating System"
for SCO UNIX System V/386 or "Open Desktop" for SCO Open Desktop to determine 
the release of the operating system. 

The SCO UNIX System V/386 Printer Supplement will update the print service by 
replacing the model interface scripts and the binary files: lpsched, lpforms, 
lpadmin, and lp.set.  Each interface script has been revised to provide support
for the use of filters.  These scripts are found in /usr/spool/lp/model.  If 
any modifications have been made to the current interface scripts, you may 
want to make a copy of the script in order to preserve those changes prior to 
installing SLS unx249c.  Also, a number of terminfo entries are provided (see 
the "FILE MODIFICATIONS" section of this document).  In addition, there is a 
new iso8859.ps character set for accessing extended characters when using a 
postscript printer.  Printing across a network using a postscript printer
has been enhanced.   

INSTALLATION

In order to install properly, you will need at least 1859 (512-byte) blocks
free on the root file system.  You may determine the number of free blocks on
the root file system beforehand by typing the command:

	# df -v /dev/root

To begin the installation of the SCO UNIX System V/386 Printer Supplement, 
bring the system into System Maintenance mode and issue the following commands:

        # cd /
	# custom

Choose "Install" and press <Return>

Select "A New Product" and press <Return>

Choose "Entire Product" and press <Return>
    
Insert the requested volume and press <Return> to continue
the installation:

        Insert: Distribution

Insert: Printer Maintenance Supplement unx249c
        Floppy Volume 1

       [Continue]    Quit  
    
The script will extract files and then tell you it is "Executing Printer
Maintenance Supplement unx249c Init Script." 

You will see:

Do you wish to relink your kernel now? (y/n) 

Choose "y" and press <Return>.

You will see:

Relinking the kernel....

        The UNIX Operating System will now be rebuilt.
        This will take a few minutes. Please wait.

        Root for this system build is /.

        The UNIX Kernel has been rebuilt.

Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n) 

Choose "y" and press <Return>.

You will see:

Backing up /unix to /unix.old
Installing new /unix

The kernel environment includes device node files and /etc/inittab
The new kernel may require changes to /etc/inittab or device nodes.

Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n) 

Choose "y" and press <Return>.

You will see:

The kernel has been successfully linked and installed.
      To activate the new kernel reboot.

The message "Press any key to continue" will appear at the bottom of the 
screen.  Another message will appear saying it is checking the "file 
permissions" and will then take you back to the menu.

The installation of SLS unx249c is now complete.  Reboot and bring the system 
into multiuser mode.  In order to reboot, issue the following at the # prompt:

         /etc/haltsys            
 
Upon completion, you will need to reconfigure your printer(s) in order to take
advantage of the support provided by the print service for the use of filters.
The newly installed enhanced printer interface script(s) will be used when you
reconfigure the printer(s). 

A description of the features that the SCO UNIX System V/386 Printer Supplement
provides follows:

UTILITY MODIFICATIONS

+ A new version of /usr/lib/lpsched(ADM), engineered especially to handle the
  use of filters and forms as specified in the documentation.  This corrects
  problems with /usr/lib/lpsched(ADM) dying with the following message when
  using the filters option:

     "UX: lp: ERROR: can't receive message from the LP print service. 
          TO FIX: The LP print service apparently has been stopped. 
          Get help from your system administrator."  
 
  The new version of lpsched also corrects a race condition that occurs between
  the scheduler and the device driver because of POSIX conformance standards.
  The following is the error you will see when this race condition occurs:

     "UX: lp: ERROR: waiting for auto-retry"

+ A more robust /usr/lib/lpforms(ADM) binary that corrects problems experienced
  when attempting to configure a form.

+ A more robust /usr/lib/lpadmin(ADM) binary that corrects problems experienced
  when administering the forms feature of the print service.

FILE MODIFICATIONS

+ All of the model printer interface scripts have been revised and upgraded to
  include support for the filters feature of the print service.  The hpjet
  model interface script also provides support for the forms feature of the 
  print service.  These revised model printer interface scripts, which replace
  the old scripts, can be found in the /usr/spool/lp/model directory. 

+ The /usr/spool/lp/bin/lp.set binary has been replaced with a revised
  /usr/spool/lp/bin/lp.set.

+ A new file called forms.readme has been added to the directory /usr/spool/lp.
  This file is a readable text file that explains how to add support for the
  forms feature of the print service to either existing interfaces or custom
  interfaces.  The file is /usr/spool/lp/forms.readme.

+ The following files are added to the terminfo database: 
   
             /usr/lib/terminfo/4/474 
             /usr/lib/terminfo/4/473
             /usr/lib/terminfo/4/495hp
             /usr/lib/terminfo/a/att473
             /usr/lib/terminfo/a/att474
             /usr/lib/terminfo/a/att495hp
             /usr/lib/terminfo/h/hplaser
             /usr/lib/terminfo/h/hplaserjet
             /usr/lib/terminfo/i/ibmgraphics    
 
   These files provide terminfo support for various printers.   

CONFIGURING A FILTER

  The following describes the steps required to configure both a printer and 
  a filter description file to take advantage of the filter.

  1. Configure the Printer

     If you do not have a printer already configured in the spooler, you will
     need to use the 'sysadmsh' to do so now.  The SCO UNIX System V/386
     System Administrator's Guide and the SCO Open Desktop Administrator's 
     Guide contain a section that explains how to configure a printer.
     
     If you already have a printer configured, the printer will need to be 
     reconfigured using the "sysadmsh" in order to take advantage of the new
     interface scripts.

  2. Create a Filter Description File

     Create a filter description file to hold the description and specifica-
     tions of the filter.  The filter description file may contain the 
     following information:

         ITEM              DEFAULT           DEFINITION
         -------------     -------           ----------

         Input types:      any               A list of file types that the
                                             filter can process.   

         Output types:     any               A list of file types that the 
                                             filter can produce as output.

         Printer types:    any               A list of printer types into which
                                             the filter can convert files.  For
                                             most filters this list is identi-
                                             cal to the output types.

         Printers:         any               A list of printers that are able
                                             to print the output of the filter.

         Filter type:      slow              A filter can be either 'fast' or
                                             'slow'.  A fast filter either 
                                             incurs little overhead or must 
                                             have access to the printer when 
					     they run.  Filters which detect 
					     printer faults must be 'fast'.
					     Slow filters are used when the 
					     filter incurs a lot of overhead 
					     or if they do not have to have 
					     access to the printer when they 
					     run.

         Command:          (no default)      The full pathname of the program 
                                             to run.  Include any fixed options
                                             that the program may need.

         Options:          (none)            Any options that the filter pro-
                                             gram will need.


     The following is an example of such a filter description file, which 
     we will call "laser.f":

             Input types: simple 
             Output types: PR (this is reference to the command)
             Printer types: hplaserjet
             Printers: laser
             Filter type: fast 
             Command: /bin/pr (this command adds the date on the file)

   3. Configure a Filter Description File

      To configure the filter for use, invoke the 'sysadmsh' and choose
      Printers->Auxiliary->Filters->Change/Add.  Enter the name you wish 
      to call the filter.  The filter name cannot be the same as the filter 
      description file name.  Finally, enter the complete path of the filter
      description file.

      The following is an example, using the filter description file 'laser.f',
      which resides in /tmp:

              Filter Name   [laserfilter]
              Path Name     [/tmp/laser.f]

      In the above example, the name of our filter is now 'laserfilter'.

   4. Configure the Printer Type

      It is necessary for the print service to know what the printer type is 
      for the printer using the filter.  In order to specify a printer type 
      for a particular printer, you will need to invoke the 'sysadmsh' and 
      choose Printers->Configure->Parameters.  Enter the printer name and the 
      printer type in the terminfo database.  (NOTE: The printer must have an 
      entry in the terminfo database in order to take advantage of this 
      feature.)  These entries can be found in /usr/lib/terminfo/x directory, 
      where x is the first letter of the terminfo entry for the printer type.

      NOTE: If the terminfo database does not contain an entry which is com-
            patible with your printer, you can create your own entry.   This
            requires looking at the printer's manual, determining which options
            are supported by the hardware, determining which of those options
            are supported by the terminfo language, developing a terminfo 
	    entry, and finally running tic(C) to re-compile the terminfo 
	    database. 

            If there is an entry in the terminfo database that is close to the
            printer type you need, you can use the command 'infocmp'(ADM) To un-
            compile the driver and edit the file to fit your printer's needs.
            It is recommended you do this in a different directory and give 
            the printer definition a different name so you can leave the 
            original one intact, for example, infocmp ibmproprinter > 
            /tmp/ibmpro.
             
            Change the name "AT" the top of the file to "ibmpro".  Make your 
            edits according to your printer manual and recompile the file 
	    ibmpro using the tic(C) command.  It will automatically be 
	    compiled into the correct directory in the terminfo database.

            For further reading, see the "termcap & terminfo" reference written
	    by Strange/O'Reilly/Mui and published by O'Reilly & Associates, 
	    Inc.  This reference provides information necessary for designing 
	    custom terminfo or termcap entries.

      The following example assumes the printer is called "laser" and that the
      printer has an entry in the terminfo database called "hplaser":

             Printer name [laser]
             Printer name in terminfo database [hplaser]
             Print wheels which can be mounted [  ]
             Alternate character set mappings  [  ] maps to [  ]
                                               [  ] maps to [  ]
                                               [  ] maps to [  ]
             Default initial settings          length [  ]  width [  ]
                                               cpi    [  ]  lpi   [  ]
                                               stty   [  ] 
                                                      [  ]
                                                      [  ]

  5. Configuring the Printer's Content Type

     Let the print service know what content type is allowed for the printer.
     The content type is the same as the output type in the filter description 
     file.  To configure the content type, invoke the 'sysadmsh' and select
     Printers->Configure->Content.  Enter the printer's name and its allowable
     content type.  The default type is 'simple'.

     The following example assumes the same printer as in the above example:

             Printer name  [laser]
             Content type allowed  [PR]
             Additional content types allowed  [  ]

  6. Testing the Filter

     In order to queue a job to be printed using a filter, issue the following
     command:
 
              lp file

     The above example assumes that 'laser' is the default printer.

     You will see the date and time print at the top of the page. 

CONFIGURING A FORM - read /usr/spool/lp/forms.readme

1. Form characteristics - Create the form using your favorite editor.  

 NOTE: The form name may be any combination of letters, digits, and underscores
       as long as it is fewer than fifteen characters.  There is no fixed limit
       on the number of forms that can be defined.

   The following is an example of the format to be used in the form description
   file when specifying the form characteristics.  It is not necessary to have
   an entry for each of these items.  Any parameters not specified will retain
   their default values:

                         Page length: 66 
                         Page width:  80
                         Number of pages: 1
                         Line pitch: 6
                         Character pitch: 10
                         Character set choice: any
                         Ribbon color: blue
                         Comment: 
                          This is a test form.
                         Alignment Pattern: 
                          /tmp/test_pattern

   Define the form's characteristics.  The characteristics of the form can 
   appear in any order, except the alignment pattern.  The alignment pattern
   must be last.  If you choose not to define a particular characteristic,
   then no entry should be included in the file for that characteristic, and 
   the default value will be used.  Should you include a characteristic in 
   the file with no value, an error message will be generated. 

   The characteristics and their default values are listed below:

      ITEM                  DEFAULT            DEFINITION
    ---------             -----------        --------------

    Page Length             66 lines         The length of a form or each 
					     page in a multiple page form.  
					     This can be expressed as number 
					     of lines or the size in inches 
					     or centimeters.

    Page Width              80 columns       The width of the form expressed in
                                             columns, inches, or centimeters.

    Number of pages         1 page           The number of pages in a multiple
                                             page form.  The print service uses
					     this number with a filter (if
                                             available) to restrict the align-
                                             ment pattern to be a single form 
                                             long.  (See description of align-
                                             ment pattern later in this sec-
                                             tion.)  If no filter is available 
					     to truncate the alignment pattern,
					     the print service, skip that step.

    Line pitch               6               How close together separate lines
                                             are on the form.  This can be
                                             expressed as lines per inch or
                                             lines per centimeter.

    Character pitch          10              How close together separate char-
                                             acters are on the form.  This can 
                                             be expressed as characters per 
                                             inch or characters per centimeter.

    Character set choice     any             The character set, print wheel, or
                                             font cartridge to be used with the
                                             form.  A user can choose a differ-
					     ent character set for the print
                                             request using this form, or insist
                                             that only one character set be
                                             used.

    Ribbon Color             any             If the form should always be 
                                             printed using a certain color 
					     ribbon, then the print service 
					     can remind you which color to 
					     use when you mount the form.

    Comment                  (no default)    Any comment you wish to make about
                                             the form.  This comment is avail-
                                             able for people to see so they can
                                             understand what the form is, and
					     when it should be used. 

    Alignment pattern        (no default)    A sample file that the Print Ser-
                                             vices use to fill one blank form.
                                             When mounting the form, you can
                                             examine this sample to see if the
                                             printing is lined up properly on
                                             the form.  If it is not, you can
                                             adjust the printer to get it lined
                                             up.
     
   The print service does not attempt to mask sensitive information in the 
   alignment pattern.  If you do not want sensitive information printed on
   sample forms, then you should mask the appropriate data.

   If the Comment has to contain a line beginning with any of the key phrases 
   (Page length, Page width, etc....), you should precede it with a ">" charac-
   ter.  The ">" character will be stripped from the displayed comment.

   YOU MUST DEFINE A TERMINFO DATABASE FILE FOR ANY PRINTER YOU INTEND TO USE
   FORMS WITH or YOU MUST ADD THE INFORMATION FROM FORMS.README INTO THE 
   INTERFACE SCRIPT. 
                    
2. Adding a form

   To add the form to the correct directory /usr/spool/lp/admins/lp/forms
   use the command below:
 
   a. /usr/lib/lpforms -f <form_name> -F <form_description>

      This will allow you to specify the form characteristics in a file and 
      submit that file (file_name) from the command line.

      NOTE: "form_name" indicates the name you are configuring the form to be
            called, and  "form_description" indicates the file that contains 
	    the form characteristics you just created.

   b. sysadmsh - To change or modify the form.

         Printers->Auxiliary->PPforms->Modify

      This will allow you to configure the form characteristics from within 
      the sysadmsh.

3. Changing or Modifying a Form

   To modify a form, re-enter one of the above commands listed in step 2. 
   "Adding a Form".  Enter only information you want altered, all other 
   information will remain unchanged.

4. Configuring the Printer to use the Form

   To configure a printer to use a form, invoke the "sysadmsh" and choose
   Printers->Auxiliary->PPforms->Configure.  Enter the printer's name and
   the names of the forms that are allowed to be used with this printer.


        Printer name [laser]
        Forms which are allowed [lzr_form]
        Forms which are not allowed [    ]


     The above example assumes that both the printer laser and the form 
     lzr_form were previously configured.

5. Alerting to mount a form

   If a print request requires a form and it is not mounted, then the print
   request will be held in the queue until the appropriate form is mounted. 

   The print service allows the administrator to be alerted when the number 
   of requests waiting has exceeded some predefined threshold.

   The alert can be defined to be received in one of four ways:

        1. The alert can be sent via electronic mail (E-MAIL).

        2. The alert can be sent to which ever terminal you are logged onto.
           See write(C).

        3. The alert can be sent through a program of your choice.

        4. No alert can be sent.  NOTE: This would require you to be respon-
           sible for checking for requests.

    The number of requests that must be queued before you are alerted can also 
    be defined.  The print service can also send repeated alerts every few 
    minutes until the form is mounted.  The rate at which these alerts appear
    can also be specified.  You can choose to receive one alert per form.

    To configure alert, invoke the "sysadmsh" and select 

    Printers->Auxiliary->PPforms->Alerts->Specify. 

6.  How to specify the print job with the form

     The form is now ready to be tested.  To queue a job to use the form, 
     issue the appropriate command found below. 

     If the printer is the default printer, type:

         lp -f <form_name> <file>

     or, if the printer is not the default printer, type:

         lp -d <printer_name> -f <form_name> <file>

7.  Mounting a form

    After a job, whig(êrequires a form, has been queued, disable the printer, 
    mount the form physically, re-enable the printer, and inform the print 
    service that the form has been physically mounted.  In order to inform
    the print service and mount the form, issue the following command:

         /usr/lib/lpadmin -p <printer_name> -M -f <form_name>

    This will allow the print service to send the queued job to the printer.

8.  Un-mounting a form

     To un-mount the form, type the following command:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p <printer_name> -M -f none

9. Determining what forms are available

   To determine which forms are configured and available, use the  
   /usr/lib/lpstat(C) command as follows:

              lpstat -f 

10. Removing a form

   There are two methods to remove a form:
  
   a.     /usr/lib/lpforms -f <form_name> -x

   b.     sysadmsh 

              Printers->Auxiliary->PPforms->Remove

11. Restricting User Access
 
   A form's use can be restricted to a subset of users.  However, lp and root
   will always have access to print using the form.

   The print service uses a list of allowed or denied users for a particular
   form to restrict the form's use.  The method of listing allowed and denied
   users is similar to the method used by "cron" and "at".

   The rules are as follows:

      A. An allow list contains a list of users allowed to use the form.  A 
         deny list contains a list of users who were denied access to a form.

      B. If the allow list is not empty, the deny list is ignored.  If the 
	 allow list is empty, the deny list is used.  If both lists are empty,
	 there are NO restrictions.

      C. Placing "any" or "all" into the allow list allows everyone to use the
         form.   Placing "any" or "all" into the deny list denies everyone 
         access, except lp and root.

    Three methods to define who is given, or denied, access to a form follow:

       A. To add names to the allow list and remove them from the deny list,
	  use:
 
               /usr/lib/lpforms -f <form_name> -u allow: <user_list>

       B. To add names to the deny list and remove them from the allow list,
	  use:

               /usr/lib/lpforms -f <form_name> -u deny: <user_list>

       C. sysadmsh

               Printers->Auxiliary->PPforms->Users
   
    "allow:all" allows everyone and "deny:all" denies everyone.  If you choose
    to list multiple users in the user_list, then the list must take on one of
    two forms:

    1. Where the list of names is separated by a space and the entire list is 
       enclosed by quotes, for example:

            /usr/lib/lpforms -f <form_name> -u "allow: jane chris terry"

    2. Where the liw4êof names is separated by commas, for example:
       
           /usr/lib/lpforms -f <form_name> -u allow: jane,terry,chris

    NOTE: If you do not add users' names to either the deny or allow lists, 
	  the print service assumes that everyone can use the form.
