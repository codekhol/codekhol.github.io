Dear SCO Customer,

Enclosed find your copy of Support Level Supplement (SLS) xnx330b.
This SLS will allow multiple logins with SCO XENIX 386 Operating Release
2.3.4p for computers based on Micro Channel Architecture (MCA).  

To install a system from the beginning, simply replace your current N1 disk
with the disk supplied with SLS xnx330b and install as usual.  To correct
problems on existing installed systems, use the following procedure:

  Reboot the system and enter System Maintenance mode. 
  
	Log in as root and type:
        
	shutdown (multi-user) or haltsys (single user)

  Use custom to replace the file "/etc/getty" as follows:

	- Type "custom".
  	- Select the Operating System option within custom.
  	- Select the option to Install a single file
  	- Enter the pathname of the getty program: /etc/getty
  	- Custom will prompt you for an Operating System Diskette.
          Insert the N1 from SLS xnx330b included in this package.
  	- Quit out of custom.

  At the root prompt, type:

        /etc/brand serialno activationkey /etc/getty 

	Note: In the above command line, you must use the Serial Number 
	(serialno) and Activation Key (activationkey) that was included
	with your original distribution.  This information can be found 
	on the pink or blue card entilted: ACTIVATION KEY.

  Reboot the system and enter multi-user mode:

	Type "haltsys".
	After the system has rebooted hit <Ctrl>-D to enter multi-user mode.
	 
  Getty will no longer give the error message "getty: Attempt to exceed 
  system login limit on ttyXX" as more tty's are enabled.
