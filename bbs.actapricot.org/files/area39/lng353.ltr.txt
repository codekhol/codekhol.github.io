Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) lng353a, the UNIX Development System
Compiler supplement, can only be installed on SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2
Operating System Version 4.0 or on SCO Open Desktop Release 2.0.  The SCO 
UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Development System Version 4.0 must be installed
prior to installing SLS lng353a.

SLS lng353a addresses the following problems:

	Extraneous messages in c1.err have been removed.

	If you had "path" (NOTE: lower case) set, and it was longer 
	than about 200 characters, with no ":"s in it, then cc would 
	dump core.  This has been resolved.

	An alternate PASSM4 can be defined in 'cc' by using the -Bm flag 
	as follows: 

	        cc -Bm /mypath/usr/bin/m4

	Many optimization problems that resulted in dropped assignments
	or incorrectly executed loops have been resolved

	cc(CP):ld was passed crt1.o twice.  This has been corrected. 

	Many incompatible assignments and invalid definitions and declarations
	that compiled without error messages now generate diagnostic error 
	messages at compile time. 

        Problems with long path names and long file names have been resolved.

	Problems with the -O option that caused compile time assertion 
	errors have been fixed. 

	When an int is shifted left by more than 32 bits the result is now 
	computed by using modulo 32 of the shift amount.

	cc(CP): A problem with strings which traverse 64k boundary being cut 
	has been fixed. 

	cc now correctly passes the -Y U flag through to ld.

	cvtomf(CP): now has correct aux entries for struct/unions. 

	m4(CP):changequote and defn now work with multiple chars.

	cc(CP): A problem with expanding very large macros causing  
	a core dump during compile time has been fixed. 

	cc(CP): sizeof a bitfield union is now correct.

	The symbol table emitted by c_1p in pass 1 of the compiler
	is no longer dependent on c_1p itself. 

	Whenever "far", "huge", or "near" are used in compiling 386
	mode code they are converted to "near" and 
	the compiler generates the error:
 	       2210: `xxx' ignored in 386 compiler

	cc(CP): Multiple static functions can now be declared in local scope. 

	cc(p1):typedefs now function correctly in structs and inside of arrays.

	cc(CP):using -32768 in a short case expression no
	longer gives a compiler warning. The valid range of 
	shorts is -32768 to 32767. 

	The functionality of -Ol has been turned off.
	The user can still specify the option via -Ol or -Ox but it does
	not get passed to the compiler passes. 
	

INSTALLATION

To begin the installation of SLS lng353a, take the following steps:

1.  Please make sure you are installing this SLS on Version 4.0 of the SCO 
    UNIX Operating System or SCO Open Desktop Release 2.0.  Version 4.0 of 
    the SCO UNIX Development System must be installed prior to installing 
    SLS lng353a.

2.  Log in as root.

3.  Next, insert Volume 1 in the floppy drive and enter the command:

	custom

    NOTE: Refer to the Release and Installation Notes and custom(C) in the SCO
	  UNIX System V/386 manuals for more information on how to use custom.

5.  To select the following, highlight with the cursor keys and press
    <Return>:

	Install -> A New Product -> Entire Product

6.  Follow the normal custom installation procedure.  The SLS lng353a will
    first validate the release of the operating system.  It will then check 
    to insure that the correct version of the development system has been 
    installed. 

    SLS lng353a will then back up the files that it will replace and put the
    files in a special directory, if ever SLS lng353a needs to be removed.

The following files are updated by SLS lng353a.

	/bin/cc
	/lib/386/c_1p
	/lib/386/p2_386
	/lib/386/p3_386m
	/lib/386/c1.err
	/usr/bin/cvtomf
	/usr/bin/m4
