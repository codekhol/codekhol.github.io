Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx329 contains a new /boot
program and is intended for use with the SCO UNIX System V/386 Release
3.2 Operating System Version 2.0 GT and SCO Open Desktop Version 1.1 GT.
SLS unx329, the 486 Boot Update, is for 386/486 AT and EISA architecture
systems that are experiencing random system panics or trouble loading the
operating system due to memory recognition or cache problems.  Please
read the entire letter before beginning the installation of this SLS to
insure proper configuration of your system.

SLS unx329 can be installed only on the GT version of the SCO UNIX System
V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 2.0, or products based on this
release, for example, SCO Open Desktop Release 1.1 GT.

SLS unx329 contains two volumes:

	1)  an N0 (N-Zero) Boot Disk and
	2)  a Custom Install Disk.

The N0 disk is used to allow installation on systems which are unable to boot
without this supplement.  The custom installation disk is used to install the 
updated boot program during or following installation of the operating system.


I.  BOOTING - OPERATING SYSTEM INSTALLATION

The N0 (N-Zero) disk labeled Volume 1 contains the new boot program in a 
form that can be directly used to boot the system.  The N0 disk may have to 
be used to install the operating system on some systems due to severe memory
recognition or cache control problems.  For these systems, the N0 disk must 
be used when booting from the floppy device.  

For the operating system installation process, every time you are instructed
to place the N1 disk into the floppy drive to boot your system, simply place 
the N0 disk in the drive instead.  When the following boot prompt is displayed 
on the console:

	Boot
	:

replace the N0 disk with the N1 disk that came with your operating system
distribution and proceed with the installation as you would normally.


Use the following procedure to install the operating system using the N0
Boot Disk:

1.  Place the N0 disk in floppy drive

2.  Manually reset the system or turn the power on.

3.  When the boot prompt is displayed:

        Boot
        :

    remove the N0 and insert the N1 into the floppy drive.


4.  Press <Return>, to continue the installation as instructed
    in the Release and Installation Notes.  Remember, there is
    one reboot as part of the installation process that will also 
    require the use of the N0 disk.

    If you forget to replace the N0 disk with the N1 disk, the system
    will display the boot string followed by the error message:

	unix not found
	Boot
	:

    Simply replace the N0 disk with the N1 disk and press <Return>.

5.  Install SLS unx329 as part of the initial installation using the
    custom utility that is invoked as part of the operating system
    installation and configuration script.  The installation script 
    will give you the opportunity to:

	1)  Install additional software (Extended Utilities or Applications)
	2)  Continue installation


    IMPORTANT: You MUST choose option 1, "Install additional software," 
	       and you MUST install SLS unx329 BEFORE the extended utilities.
 
               The new boot program MUST be installed on the hard disk for 
	       the system to work correctly. 

               When selecting to install additional software, the custom 
	       program is run.  Remember to install SLS unx329 BEFORE the 
	       extended utilities.

   
   - Position the cursor so that 'Install' is highlighted and 
     press <Enter>.

   - Make sure that the words 'A New Product' are highlighted in the window 
     found in the lower right hand corner of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - Make sure the words 'Entire Product' are highlighted in the 'Choose an
     option' section of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - You will be prompted to 'Insert distribution Volume 1 and press <Return>'.
     Insert the diskette labeled '486 Boot Update, Custom Install Disk' 
     and press <Enter>.

   - You will see the following messages:

       Installing custom data files
       Executing Product Prep Script
   
   - At the bottom of the screen, you will be prompted to 'Press any key to
     continue'.  Press <Enter>

   - The message 'Creating file lists' will flash on the screen.  You will 
     be prompted to 'Insert the requested Volume and press <Return>'.  The 
     diskette is already in the drive, therefore press <Enter>

   - You will see the following message:

       Extracting Files
     
   - You will then be prompted to 'Press any key to continue'; press <Enter>.

6.  Continue with the rest of the normal operating system installation
    process as described in the Release and Installation Notes.



II.   INSTALLATION (for systems already running SCO UNIX System V/386 Release
		    3.2 Version 2.0 GT or SCO Open Desktop 1.1 GT)

Use the following procedure to install SLS unx329 on an existing operating
system using the Custom Install Disk:

1.  If the system is running in multiuser mode, log in as root and enter 
    the command:

	shutdown -g0

    The system will then execute a controlled shutdown operation which
    will display the following message when the shutdown process has
    completed:

	**   Safe to Power Off   **
	           -or-
	** Press Any Key to Reboot **

2.  Reboot the system.

3.  When the system reboots, you will see the message:

	Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
	(or give root password for system maintenance):

    Enter the root password and press <Return>.
    Wait until the "#" prompt appears.

4.  Next, insert the custom volume diskette labeled '486 Boot Update, Custom
    Install Disk' in the floppy drive and enter the command:
    drive and enter the command:

	/etc/custom

    The custom menu will appear.

5.  To select the following, highlight with the cursor keys and press
    <Return>:

	Install -> A New Product -> Entire Product

       Executing Product Prep Script
   
   - At the bottom of the screen, you will be prompted to 'Press any key to
     continue'.  Press <Enter>

   - The message 'Creating file lists' will flash on the screen.  You will 
     be prompted to 'Insert the requested Volume and press <Return>'.  The 
     diskette is already in the drive, therefore press <Enter>

   - You will see the following message:

       Extracting Files

   - You will then be prompted to 'Press any key to continue'; press <Enter>.

   - At the main custom menu, move the highlighted entry to 'Quit' and press
     <Enter>.  Press <Enter> again on the highlighted 'yes'.  
     

    The SLS unx329 preparation script will validate the operating system 
    release, version, and type.  The operating system validation information
    found will be displayed by the script.

    If the validation is successful, the script will then save the original 
    boot program to the file named boot.preunx329 in the root (/) directory. 

    If the validation fails, the script informs the user and forces the custom 
    utility to abort the installation.


III. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

		    Contents of SLS unx329, the 486 Boot Update

	   o If	the target machine is a	486 processor, the internal
	     cache is turned off for the duration of the memory sizing
	     and then turned back on.  The state of the internal cache 
	     before memory sizing is not queried, so if a machine has 
	     had the cache turned off previously (from a configuration 
	     floppy, for example) this code will turn it back on at the 
	     conclusion of memory sizing.

	   o During memory sizing, after a value has been written to
	     memory, and before it is compared to see if the memory
	     existed at	that location, an instruction is issued to
	     flush the external cache, if it exists.  The hardware 
	     vendor will need to implement this instruction properly
	     for their own external cache.

	   o Also, during memory sizing, NMI interrupts are disabled.
	     Some machines generate an NMI (signifying a parity	error)
	     when non-existent memory is touched; boot is not built to 
	     handle such a situation.  After memory sizing is complete, 
	     NMI interrupts are re-enabled (after clearing any possible 
	     parity errors that might have occurred).

	   o The values	written	to memory to determine if a given location
	     is valid are now 32 bits, instead of 16 bits.

	   o There is code in boot to do rudimentary memory specification.
	     You may specify where the system should look for memory.  The 
	     syntax is:

	       mem=start-end[/d],start1-end1[/d], ...

	     where start, end, start1, and end1 are examples of	linear
	     memory addresses, specified as a decimal number and a
	     multiplier	of either an "m" or "k", meaning megabyte or
	     kilobyte, respectively.

	     The "/d" option specifies that the region should be memory 
	     sized from the top of the range down to the bottom of the 
	     range, instead of from the bottom to the top (the default).

	     The memory specification string is entered at the Boot: prompt.  
	     The Boot: prompt is then displayed again to allow entry of the 
	     boot string.
