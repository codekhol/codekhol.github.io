Dear SCO Customer,

Enclosed find your copy of Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx233.
This SLS will allow you to install SCO UNIX Operating System Release
3.2.0 and later for Micro Computers based on Micro Channel Architecture
on systems using IBM ESDI drives manufactured by Seagate Technologies 
(e.g. ST 177i 60 MB). To use this supplement, replace the N1 diskette
provided with your original distribution with the N1 diskette supplied
with this supplement; and install the Volume 1 diskette with custom
after the installation process (detailed instructions follow).


1. Start the installation by booting from the new N1 diskette.
   (SCO ESDI Supplement to SCO UNIX 386MC - Volume N1)
   Follow the instructions as displayed on the screen. If you are asked
   during the installation process to relink the kernel you must
   say no, as you cannot do so until after the Volume 1 diskette has 
   been installed.  Again, DO NOT RE-LINK THE KERNEL UNTIL AFTER YOU
   HAVE INSTALLED Volume 1 below. Complete the installation normally
   as instructed and reboot the system.
