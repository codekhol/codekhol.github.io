Dear Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) lng227 replaces the icmp,
tcp, cp, and udp protocol drivers for SCO TCP/IP Release 1.1.1, both for
the standalone product and for the SCO TCP/IP portion of Open Desktop
Release 1.0.0.  The new drivers are enhanced versions which allow for
better communication and correct various problems encountered with these
protocols and drivers, evident in some third party application programs.

SLS lng227 also contains a new /etc/cpd daemon that only checks for copy
protection violations on bootup, as opposed to a periodic check which
presents an unwanted network load.

The directions for installation of this SLS are as follows:

1. Reboot your system and enter System Maintenance mode.

2. Insert the enclosed diskette into the drive.

3. Type "/etc/xinstall"

4. Type "y" at the prompt "First floppy? (y/n)"

5. Type "y" at the prompt "Do you wish to relink the kernel now? (y/n)"

6. Type "y" at the prompt "Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n)"

7. Type "y" at the prompt "Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)"

8. Type "n" at the prompt "Next floppy? (y/n)"


If an error occurs during installation of the SLS, please follow the
directions printed on the screen to diagnose the situation and continue
with the installation. 

Installation of this SLS will not affect any SCO TCP/IP configuration
files. 

Yours sincerely,


Technical Support Department
