System Version 4.2 only.  Be sure to use the correct replacement N1 for your 
SCO operating system version.  See Troubleshooting, section IV, for further
details on installation.

The new N1 diskette OBSOLETES your current N1.  Please replace your current 
N1 with the Replacement N1 diskette from SLS UOD383A. 


I. BOOTING - OPERATING SYSTEM INSTALLATION

The Replacement N1 diskette OBSOLETES your previous N1 diskette.  If you
have not already done so, please mark your previous N1 as obsolete and
use the N1 supplied with SLS UOD383A.

For the operating system installation process, every time you are instructed
to place the N1 diskette into the floppy drive to boot your system, simply
place the Replacement N1 diskette in the drive instead.  Then proceed with
the normal installation of the operating system distribution.


Take the following steps to install the operating system using the SLS
UOD383A Replacement N1 diskette:

1.  Place the Replacement N1 diskette in the floppy drive.

2.  Manually reset the system or turn the power on.

3.  The boot prompt will be displayed:

        Boot:

4.  Follow normal installation procedures as outlined in the Release and
    Installation Notes.  

5.  After installation is complete, when you get the "SAFE to POWER OFF"
    message, take the following steps:

    a. Make sure the Replacement N1 diskette is in the floppy drive.
    b. Press <Enter> to reboot the computer.
    c. When the BOOT: prompt appears, type the following:

         fd(64)unix  root=hd(40) swap=hd(41)

    d. After loading text and data you will see the following message:
    
         Type CONTROL-d  to proceed with normal startup,
         (or give root password for system maintenance):

       Enter the root password and press <Enter>.
       
    e. Invoke custom(ADM) by typing "custom" at the command prompt; 
       press <Enter>.

II. INSTALLATION (for systems already running SCO Open Desktop 3.0 or 
      SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.2)

For installations that are upgrading from another SCSI host adapter to 
the IBM SCSI-2 host adapter, the following procedure should be used before 
removing the original SCSI host adapter. 

The following procedure outlines how to install SLS UOD383A on an existing
operating system using custom(ADM):

1.  If the system is running in multiuser mode, log in as root on the 
    console.  After warning the users that the system will be down for 
    some time, enter the command:

       init 1 

    The system will then execute a controlled shutdown operation which
    will bring it to System Maintenance mode.  You will see the prompt: 

        Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
        (or give root password for System Maintenance):

    Enter the root password and press <Enter>.
    Wait until the "#" prompt appears.

2.  Next, insert the custom volume diskette for SLS UOD383A 
    in the floppy drive and enter the command:

        /etc/custom

    The custom menu will appear.

3.  To select the following, highlight each one with the cursor keys 
    and press <Enter>:

        Install -> A New Product -> Entire Product

   - Position the cursor so that "Install" is highlighted and 
     press <Enter>.

   - Make sure that the words "A New Product" are highlighted in the window 
     found in the lower right-hand corner of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - Make sure the words "Entire Product" are highlighted in the "Choose an
     option" section of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - You will be prompted to "Insert distribution Volume 1 and press <Enter>."
     The diskette is already in the drive, therefore press <Enter>.

   - You will see the following message:

       Installing custom data files
   
   - The message "Creating file lists" will flash on the screen.  You will 
     be prompted to "Insert the requested Volume and press <Enter>."  The 
     diskette is already in the drive, therefore press <Enter>.

   - You will see the following message:

       Extracting Files

   - You will then be returned to the main custom menu where you should
     see "IBM Hardware Support SLS for UNIX/ODT" listed as one of the
     installed products. 

   - At the main custom menu, move the highlighted entry to "Quit" and 
     press <Enter>.  Press <Enter> again on the highlighted "yes."

   - Relink the kernel by entering the following commands:

           cd /etc/conf/cf.d
           ./link_unix

   - During the relink process, you will be asked if you want to boot 
     off the new kernel and if you want to rebuild the kernel environment.

     Reply Y to both questions.

   - Shut down the computer.  Remove the SCSI-1 adapter and install the 
     SCSI-2 adapter.  Reboot the computer.

   - SLS UOD383A is now successfully installed.



III. FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS OF SLS UOD383A

SLS UOD383A includes the following functional components:

1. A new /boot which correctly addresses the IBM SCSI-2 Fast Wide Adapter/A 
   host adapter; and a new /etc/conf/pack.d/hf/Driver.o and /etc/conf/pack.d/
   hf/space.c file for the IBM SCSI-2 Fast Wide Adapter/A.  

2. New tape drivers for the IBM 1.2 GB 1/4" Cartridge SCSI Tape Drive, the 
   2.3 GB 8mm Full High SCSI tape drive, and the 2.0 GB 4mm tape SCSI
   Tape Drive.


IV. TROUBLESHOOTING

The following errors may occur if the wrong N1 diskette is used during
installation of SCO Open Desktop or SCO UNIX Operating System with SLS 
UOD383A.  This could happen if the N1 for SCO UNIX Operating System is 
used for SCO Open Desktop, or the N1 for SCO Open Desktop is used for 
SCO UNIX Operating System.  

1. If SCO UNIX Version 4.2 is installed using the UOD383A SCO Open Desktop 
   N1 diskette:

   Installation may fail on M1 with the following error messages:

     " /inst3/fixmaster: mv: not found

      Error: cannot open bundle list

      The /inst4/rtsinstall installation program has failed.

      Call your Support Representative if you require assistance.

      Installation aborted.

      After the "Power off or reboot" prompt is displayed,
      you may power down the system if required. 

      To resume the installation procedure from the aborted point:
              1. insert N1 (Boot) floppy in the drive,
              2. close the drive door, then press any key.

      The screen will clear and display the "Boot:" prompt.


      **    Safe to Power Off   **
               - or -
      **  Press Any Key to Reboot  ** "


2. If SCO Open Desktop 3.0 is installed using the UOD383A SCO UNIX 
   Version 4.2 N1, then installation may fail on M1 with the following 
   error message:

     " ERROR:   /inst5/customize

      Call your Support Representative if you require assistance.

      Installation aborted. 

      After the "Power off or reboot" prompt is displayed,
      you may power down the system if required. 

      To resume the installation procedure from the aborted point,
              1. insert N1 (Boot) floppy in the drive,
              2. close the drive door, then press any key.

      The screen will clear and display the "Boot:" prompt.


      **    Safe to Power Off   **
               - or -
      **  Press Any Key to Reboot  ** "


The solution is to be sure to use the correct N1 diskette and restart the 
installation by booting off the correct N1 and typing the word "restart" 
at the boot: prompt.
