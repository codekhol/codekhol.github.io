Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) UOD399A corrects problems 
found in kernel modules in these products:

	  SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.2
	  SCO Open Server Enterprise System Release 3.0
	  SCO Open Server Network System Release 3.0
	  SCO Open Desktop Release 3.0
	  SCO Open Desktop Lite Release 3.0

The kernel module problems corrected by SLS UOD399A are:

   - A synchronous write to a file when the file system is full 
     hangs the operating system.

   - A possible system hang when performing raw transfers 
     above 16 MB of physical memory.

Performance enhancements: 

   - Modifications have been made to kernel modules to improve 
     performance when SCO NFS is being used.
