Dear SCO Customer,


Enclosed find Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx251.  This SLS
resolves outstanding problems with the SCO UNIX Operating System 
Release 3.2 Version 2.0 GT.  These problems will be fixed in the 
upcoming release for computers based on Micro Channel Architecture
so the supplement will only be required for Industry Standard
Architecture (AT) based computers.  The Supplement is also not 
applicable to Operating Systems with SCO MPX installed.  The 
following problems are resolved by installing SLS unx251:


	1) Processes using the plock() system call would hang
	   indefinitely.  Ps(C) would show the process state 
	   as "B" when this occured.

	2) Under a rare set of conditions, the in-core inode 
	   table would appear to end up with an invalid
	   entry.  In actuality, the problem was with the 
	   directory name cache scheme which was added to 
	   improve performance in the SCO UNIX System V/386 
	   Operating System Release 3.2 Version 2.0 - hence 
	   fsck would not detect an error.

	3) 14 character directory names could not be renamed.


                         INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
                       =============================

To install SLS unx251, insert the floppy into your floppy drive 
and, at a root prompt, type:


    /etc/xinstall
        
You will see the following message:

    For each volume in the distribution set, insert the
    floppy into the drive, enter 'y', and press <RETURN>.
    Enter the letter 'n' after the last volume.
    
    Should you see the message 'tar: please mount new volume'
    insert the next floppy, and press <RETURN>.

    First Floppy? (y/n)

At this point enter 'y' and press <RETURN>.  You will then see the 
message:

    Extracting files...
    
If you do not have the LINK kit installed, you will be prompted with 
the following message:

    You must have the LINK kit installed
    Do you wish to install the LINK kit now (y/n)

Enter 'y' and then <RETURN>.  You will then be prompted for the 
diskettes, and the serial number and activation key, all of which 
were supplied with your SCO UNIX System V/386 Operating System Release 
3.2 Version 2.0.  Once this process is complete, or if you already 
have the LINK kit installed on your system, you will then see the 
following messages:

    Backing up /etc/conf/pack.d/kernel/os.o /etc/conf/pack.d/kernel/os.o.bak
    Backing up /etc/conf/pack.d/s5/Driver.o /etc/conf/pack.d/s5/Driver.o.bak
    Backing up /usr/include/sys/nami.h /usr/include/sys/nami.h.bak 


    	The UNIX Operating System will now be rebuilt.
    	This will take a few minutes.  Please wait.

    	Root for this system build is /

    	The UNIX Kernel has been rebuilt.

    Do you want this kernel to boot by default (y/n)
    
Enter 'y' followed by <RETURN>.  You will see the message:

    Backing up /unix to /unix.old
    Installing new /unix

    The kernel environment includes device node files and /etc/inittab.
    The new kernel may require changes to /etc/inittab or device nodes.

    Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)

Enter 'n' followed by <RETURN> and you will see the message:

    Device node or inittab changes associated with this new kernel have not
    been made.  These changes should be made by running touch /etc/new_unix;
    /etc/conf/bin/mkenv.

    Next Floppy? (y/n)



At this point, enter 'n' followed by <RETURN>.  You must now reboot the 
system so that the changes made by SLS unx251 can take effect.  To shutdown 
your system, first make certain that all users are logged off the system; 
then enter the command:

    shutdown -g0 -y

The fix will take effect when your system is rebooted.  Note that if
you re-install your LINK kit, you will need to re-install SLS unx251.
