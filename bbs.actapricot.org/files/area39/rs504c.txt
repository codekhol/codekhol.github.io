    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  RS504C supersedes Release Supplements 504A and 504B (RS504A
       and RS504B).
    _________________________________________________________________________


    If you have questions regarding this supplement, or the product on which
    it is installed, please contact your software supplier.


 Who should install the supplement?

    Install this supplement on all SCO OpenServer 5.0.4 systems, including
    systems with RS504A or RS504B previously installed.


 Installing the supplement

    You can install RS504C from distribution media (such as a CD-ROM or a
    floppy disk) or from media images on a software server or web site.

    The supplement consists of four VOL files.  If you download the
    supplement as media images, make sure you have all four files.

    To install the supplement:

    1.  Log in as root.

    2.  Start the Software Manager by double-clicking its icon on the
        desktop, or by entering the following at the command-line prompt:

           scoadmin software


    3.  From the Software menu, select Install New.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  You no longer need to run Load and Apply for a supplement
           (which is a software patch), as you did in SCO OpenServer
           Releases 5.0.0 and 5.0.2.  Now you install a supplement using
           the same procedure you use to install any software product.
        _________________________________________________________________________


    4.  When prompted for the host (machine), select the current host and
        then Continue.

    5.  In the Select Media window:

        a.  If you are loading this release supplement from a media image,
            click on Media Device and select Media Images, then Continue.
            (You may need to pull down the scroll bar before you see the
            Media Images option.)

            In the Enter Image Directory window, enter the absolute pathname
            for the directory in which the media images reside; for example:

               /tmp

            Click on OK.

        b.  If you are loading this release supplement from a CD-ROM or
            floppy disk, select the appropriate drive and then Continue.

    6.  The Install Selection window lists the three supplements included in
        RS504C.

           You must install the Software Manager Supplement first.

        Select only the ``Software Manager Supplement'', then click on
        Install.

        There is a short delay while the installation takes place, and a
        message instructs you to restart the Software Manager before
        installing the rest of RS504C.

    7.  In the Installation Complete window, click on OK.  The Software
        Manager should now list the Software Manager Supplement.

    8.  Exit the Software Manager by selecting Host, then Exit.  Then restart
        the Software Manager, now patched by the supplement you just
        installed.

    9.  From the Software menu, select Install New.

    10. When prompted for the host (machine), select the current host and
        then Continue.

    11. In the Select Media window:

        a.  If you are loading this release supplement from a media image,
            click on Media Device and select Media Images, then Continue.
            (You may need to pull down the scroll bar before you see the
            Media Images option.)

            In the Enter Image Directory window, enter the absolute pathname
            for the directory in which the media images reside; for example:

               /tmp

            Click on OK.

        b.  If you are loading this release supplement from a CD-ROM or
            floppy disk, select the appropriate drive and then Continue.

    12. In the Install Selection window, select one or both of the remaining
        supplements.  (If you do not want any of the new drivers under
        Supplemental Graphics Hardware Support, you do not need to install
        them.)  Click on Install.

        There is a short delay while the installation takes place.

    13. In the Installation Complete window, click on OK.  The Software
        Manager should list the supplements you selected.  The patched
        software is now installed.

    14. Exit the Software Manager by selecting Host, then Exit.

    15. Reboot the machine.  The Software Manager automatically relinks the
        kernel after each installation.  You must reboot before the new
        kernel takes effect.


 Installing the release supplement across the network

    You can install the supplement from one SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.4
    machine onto another across a TCP/IP network.  To do so, you need a
    software server, which you can create as described in Chapter  19,
    ``Installing and managing software over the network'' in the Networking
    Guide.  This server has a user account called swadmin.

    Use the Software Manager to install or load RS504C on the software
    server.  (See this cover letter's section entitled ``Installing the
    supplement''.)

    To install the supplement onto a local machine from the software server,
    start the Software Manager and select Install New.  In the Begin
    Installation window, you are prompted for the source location of the
    patch.  Select From Another Host.  You will need to provide the name of
    the software server, as well as the password of the swadmin user on the
    software server.


 Removing the supplement

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  You must remove software patches (such as release
       supplements) in the reverse order of their installation.  In other
       words, if you installed ``Patch1'', then ``Patch2'', then
       ``Patch3'', you must remove ``Patch3'', then ``Patch2'', before you
       can remove ``Patch1''.
    _________________________________________________________________________


    To remove a supplement:

    1.  Log in as root.

    2.  Start the Software Manager by double-clicking its icon on the
        desktop, or by entering the following at the command-line prompt:

           scoadmin software


    3.  Select the title of the supplement you are removing.

    4.  From the Software menu, select Remove Software.  In the confirmation
        window, verify that you selected the right supplement, then click on
        Remove.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           CAUTION  Removing a patch in SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.4
           corresponds to rolling it back and unloading it in earlier SCO
           OpenServer releases.  If you need to keep a copy of a patch
           loaded, see ``Removing software'' in the SCO OpenServer
           Handbook.
        _________________________________________________________________________

        There is a short delay, then the Removal complete window appears.
        Click on OK.  The Software Manager should no longer list the
        supplement you removed.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  Some effects of certain supplements are irreversible
           because of the nature of the correction (for example, restoring
           correct permissions on system directories).  However, removing
           the supplement will remove the patch name from the system.
        _________________________________________________________________________


    5.  When you have finished removing and installing software, exit the
        Software Manager by selecting Host, then Exit.


 SCO SMP and RS504C

    If you are installing both RS504C and SCO SMP(r), install SCO SMP first.
    If you install SCO SMP at a later time, remove RS504C first, then
    reinstall RS504C after installing SCO SMP.

    When you remove RS504C:

         In the Confirm Selected Software window, click on More options, then
         select Leave Loaded.

    To reinstall RS504C:

         In the Select Media window, select Loaded Software as the media
         device.  Then select RS504C for installation.

    See this cover letter's sections entitled ``Removing the supplement'' and
    ``Installing the supplement''.


 Preserving customized files

    RS504C backs up the following user-configurable files, then modifies or
    replaces them:

       /etc/conf/pack.d/ip/space.c
       /etc/conf/pack.d/arp/space.c
       /etc/conf/pack.d/eeE/space.c
       /etc/conf/pack.d/kernel/space.c
       /etc/default/inet
       /etc/gettydefs
       /etc/rc0
       /etc/rc1
       /etc/rc2
       /etc/rc2.d/K25pm
       /etc/rc2.d/S25pm
       /etc/rc3
       /etc/grafinfo/grafdev

    If you have customized any of these files, you can restore your changes
    from the backed-up copies after you install the supplement.  The files
    are backed up to:

       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/conf/pack.d/ip/space.c
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/conf/pack.d/arp/space.c
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/conf/pack.d/eeE/space.c
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/conf/pack.d/kernel/space.c
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/default/inet
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/gettydefs
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/rc0
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/rc1
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/rc2
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/rc2.d/K25pm
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/rc2.d/S25pm
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/rc3
       /usr/lib/custom/rs504c.sav/etc/grafinfo/grafdev



 Networking Maintenance Supplement (oss449f)

    RS504c includes all the fixes from the Support Level Supplement oss449f
    (the Networking Maintenance Supplement), and replaces oss449f as well as
    supplements oss449a through oss449e (the Networking Performance SLS).
    These fixes address many known problems with the nfs, tcp, and Unix
    components of SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.4.


 wd driver: delay searching for ATAPI device

    You can now specify how long the wd driver searches for an ATAPI device
    at boot time.  Use the wd.delay bootstring as follows:

         wd.delay       driver stops search after 4 seconds

         wd.delay=N     driver stops search after N seconds

    If you do not specify the wd.delay bootstring, the driver searches for 31
    seconds.


 Sending kernel messages to a multiscreen

    You can now send kernel messages to a given multiscreen, using a
    bootstring.  At the boot prompt, enter:

       unix cn.console=x

    where x is a multiscreen number from 1 to 12.

    For example, to redirect console messages to screen 3, enter:

       unix cn.console=3

       NOTE  Consider the capabilities of your monitor when determining
       which resolution to configure. Do not select a resolution that is
       higher than the maximum resolution supported by your monitor.
       Also, if you select resolutions of 1024x768 or 1280x1024, you may
       need to determine if your monitor works in interlaced or non-
       interlaced mode at these resolutions.  Consult your monitor's
       documentation for information regarding supported resolutions.

 Memory requirements for SCO OpenServer

    The SCO OpenServer Release Notes mention a Small Memory Supplement to be
    made available for systems with less than 16MB RAM.  That reference is
    incorrect; there is no such supplement.  SCO OpenServer requires at least
    16MB RAM.  We recommend at least 32MB RAM.



 Installing and configuring SCO VisionFS 1.2

    RS504C contains no changes to SCO VisionFS(TM) 1.2.  The following
    information is provided for those who might wish to install and configure
    SCO VisionFS 1.2 at this time.

    An SCO VisionFS 1.2 license comes in the package with SCO OpenServer
    Release 5.0.4.  Use that license when you install SCO VisionFS from the
    same CD-ROM from which you installed SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.4.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  An evaluation-only version of SCO VisionFS is contained on
       the SCO Vision Family Evaluation CD, which also comes in the
       package with SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.4.  If you choose to
       install this evaluation version of SCO VisionFS, do not use the SCO
       VisionFS 1.2 license.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    To access the instructions for SCO VisionFS 1.2 from the SCO OpenServer
    CD-ROM, mount the CD-ROM using the following command at the system
    prompt:

       mount -r /dev/cd0 /mnt

    You can then read the text file /mnt/visionfs/readme.txt.  Or you can
    access the document in Netscape by entering:

       netscape /mnt/readme.htm

    From the Overview section, select the hot link ``SCO VisionFS 1.2+'',
    which refers you to the SCO VisionFS installation instructions on the
    CDROM.

    Read the installation information carefully before continuing with the
    installation.

    To learn how to operate SCO VisionFS 1.2 after installation, read the
    text file /mnt/visionfs/relnotes.txt.  Or access the document in
    Netscape:

       netscape /mnt/readme.htm

    and select the hot link ``SCO VisionFS Release Notes''.
