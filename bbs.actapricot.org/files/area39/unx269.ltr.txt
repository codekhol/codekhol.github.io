Dear SCO Customer,

Enclosed is Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx269. This SLS installs
a new /etc/conf/pack.d/kernel/os.o which is intended to resolve the system
sigclean panics you may have been experiencing under SCO UNIX System
V/386 Release 3.2 AT Operating Systems.  In particular SCO customers who
use the FOCUS application by Information Builders have experienced this
problem. This SLS is not designed to install on Micro Channel (MC)
systems, and although it will install, you will not be able to boot
the new kernel.

To install SLS unx269 follow the instructions below: 

  1. It is recommended but not mandatory that SLS unx269 be installed in
     System Maintenance mode. To get to System Maintenance mode you must
     reboot your machine and type the root password at the System Maintenance
     mode prompt. Otherwise, you must log in as root. 

  2. Ensure that your are located in the root directory by entering the
     following command:

     # cd /

  3. Run the /etc/xinstall utility by executing the following command:

     # /etc/xinstall

     You will be prompted for the first floppy, insert SLS unx269 into
     the floppy drive, enter "y" and press <Return>.

     The install script will check and make sure you are on an SCO UNIX
     System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System and that the Link Kit is
     correctly installed.  It will then install the new os.o and relink
     a new kernel.

     After the installation is complete you will be prompted for the next
     floppy, you should answer "n" to this prompt and press <Return>.

  4. After you have exited from the /etc/xinstall program you will need to
     reboot your machine for the SLS to take effect.
