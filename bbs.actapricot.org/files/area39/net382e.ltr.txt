Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) NET382E contains 
TCP/IP drivers and daemons for these products:

SCO TCP/IP Release 1.2.1 for SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Version 4.2
SCO Open Desktop Lite Release 3.0
SCO Open Desktop Release 3.0
SCO Open Server Network System Release 3.0
SCO Open Server Enterprise System Release 3.0


SLS NET382E contains these new features:

1. A new /usr/lib/sendmail that addresses security issues.

2. A new socket driver that corrects problems with hanging
   network connections with SLS NET382D.

These new drivers and binaries contain all the features mentioned 
below where appropriate.

SLS NET382E contains the following features that were also part of
SLS NET382C, SLS NET382B, and NET382D:

1. A new PPP driver that properly rejects unknown options. 

2. A new /usr/lib/sendmail that includes additional security enhancements.

3. A new TCP driver that corrects problems with streams buffer allocation.

4. A new socket driver that corrects problems encountered using some
   advanced socket functions.

5. A new /usr/bin/rdist is provided that corrects problems which might 
   have allowed unauthorized access to the system.

6. A new /usr/lib/sendmail and /usr/bin/lmail are provided for those sites 
   using sendmail as their mail system. These new binaries correct problems 
   that might have allowed unauthorized access to the system.

7. A new /etc/cpd daemon that corrects a problem that caused a system
   using PPP to dial out upon bootup.

8. A new /usr/bin/rcp corrects a condition where permission to open 
   a socket is denied when using wild cards to copy files.

9. A new /etc/telnetd designed to eliminate core dumps when TCP/IP 
   is used in conjunction with MPX.

10. A new tcp driver (/etc/conf/pack.d/tcp/Driver.o) modified for 
    these reasons:

    a. This new driver allows multiple bytes of OOB data.
    b. A panic situation is avoided when a TCP state variable is equal to 0.
    c. A panic situation is avoided when using TLI expedited data.
    d. Eliminates duplicate <RST> being sent when a <SYN> is received on a
       connection.
    e. A panic situation is avoided when using TCP_DEBUG on a socket.
    f. A possible six second delay is eliminated between multiple 
       invocations of rcmd or rcp.

11. A new netbios driver (/etc/conf/pack.d/nb/Driver.o and 
    /etc/conf/pack.d/nb/space.c) modified for these reasons:

    a. A panic situation is avoided during multiple inits.
    b. Eliminates problems with a NEC localized LAN Manager server 
       connecting to a Microsoft LAN Manager for SCO UNIX server.
    c. A new configurable parameter in /etc/conf/pack.d/nb/space.c
       (nb_sendkeepalives) has been created and can be set to 0 (default) 
       to disable netbios keepalives, or to 1 to enable them.

12. A new pseudo tty driver (/etc/conf/pack.d/spt/Driver.o) corrects 
    a hang condition which occurs when using PC-Interface for DOS to 
    create virtual terminal connections.

13. A new /usr/bin/tftp and the associated daemon, /etc/tftpd, have been 
    modified to avoid a situation in which the tftpd daemon loses 
    synchronization and will not respond to incoming or outgoing packets.

14. A new /etc/snmpd daemon is included that provides support for SNMP 
    Multiplexing (SMUX) peers. The new daemon also corrects a problem 
    that caused the original SNMP daemon to allocate extraneous amounts 
    of memory that would eventually affect system performance.  The new 
    snmpd also allows proper recognition of traps sent from a SMUX peer.
    The original snmpd considered all traps sent from a SMUX peer to be 
    Authentication Failure traps.

15. A new socket driver, (/etc/conf/pack.d/socket/Driver.o), is included
    that provides the ability to set non-blocking mode on a socket via the 
    O_NONBLOCK argument to the fcntl() system call.

16. A new /etc/rlogind is provided that corrects a problem where extraneous 
    characters were occasionally displayed during the login process. 
    Additionally, this new /etc/rlogind daemon allows the TERM environment 
    variable to be passed correctly to the new shell that is spawned by the 
    login process.

17. A new /etc/bootpd is provided that correctly handles requests for files 
    to be downloaded via tftp when the tftp daemon is running in secure mode.

18. A new /etc/rshd is provided that correctly handles time zone variables
    when using rcmd(TC).

Additionally, this SLS provides the following drivers, daemons, utilities, 
and files that provide better interaction between the Point-to-Point Protocol
(PPP) subsystem and the rest of the TCP/IP software:

         /etc/conf/pack.d/ip/Driver.o
         /etc/conf/pack.d/ppp/Driver.o
         /etc/conf/pack.d/asyh/Driver.o
         /etc/pppd
         /etc/pppstat
         /usr/lib/ppp/ppp
         /etc/syslogd
         /usr/include/sys/netinet/ppp.h
         /usr/include/sys/netinet/asyhdlc.h

Some of the features provided by the new PPP subsystem are:

         Ability to log PPP start-up negotiation sequences to 
          /usr/adm/syslog - see the usage notes below.

         Proper use of Domain Name Service (DNS) to avoid querying 
          a remote nameserver during connection establishment.

         Ability to reset an interface when a connection has been
          aborted.

         The default Async Control Character Map is now ffffffff
          for Request for Comments (RFC) 1331 compliancy.


Notes Regarding SCO Global Access:

SCO Global Access Release 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 contain SLS NET382B, a previous
revision of SLS NET382E.  Although SLS NET382E supersedes the previous SLS,
due to the custom(ADM) bundle technology with which SCO Global Access is
built, care must be taken when attempting to install both SCO Global Access
and SLS NET382E.

If you are about to install SLS NET382E on a system with SCO Global Access 
Release 3.0.0 or 3.0.1 already installed, you must first edit the file 
/etc/perms/bundle/gaccessb and locate the following set of lines:

#
macropkg="NET382B" : macro="SCO NET382B SLS"
#
macropkg="NET382B" : prd=net382 : perms=./tmp/perms/net382 : rel=2.0.0 :
 comp="SCO NET382B SLS" : vols=01 : mapping=1 : compsize=2880
#

Comment out the lines with the "#" character as follows:

#
# macropkg="NET382B" : macro="SCO NET382B SLS"
#
# macropkg="NET382B" : prd=net382 : perms=./tmp/perms/net382 : rel=2.0.0 :
#  comp="SCO NET382B SLS" : vols=01 : mapping=1 : compsize=2880
#

This will prevent the system from requiring that the SLS be installed 
from the Global Access media.  While editing this file, do not make a 
copy of the file /etc/perms/bundle/gaccessb in the directory 
/etc/perms/bundle, as that will confuse the custom(ADM) program.

Do NOT attempt to install SCO Global Access Release 3.0.0 or 3.0.1 on 
a system where SLS NET382E is already installed.  If you wish to install 
SCO Global Access Release 3.0.0 or 3.0.1 at a later time, please remove 
SLS NET382E with custom(ADM) prior to doing so.  You may then reinstall 
SLS NET382E after installing SCO Global Access Release 3.0.0 or 3.0.1, 
taking note of the step previously outlined in this section. 


Notes Regarding the SCO Secure TCP/IP Utilities:

SLS NET382E does not have any knowledge of the SCO Secure TCP/IP 
Utilities packaged with SCO Security Server Release 1.0.3.  If SLS 
NET382E is installed after the SCO Secure TCP/IP Utilities are 
installed, you will have to reinstall /etc/rlogind and /etc/telnetd 
from the SCO Secure TCP/IP Utilities media.  Alternatively, you could 
back up these two files prior to installing SLS NET382E, so that they 
can be restored after installing the SLS. 


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

This SLS supersedes SLS NET372A, SLS NET379A, SLS NET382A, SLS NET382B, 
SLS NET382C, and NET382D.  You may install SLS NET382E with or without 
the presence of any combination of the older supplements already installed 
on a system.  However, the earlier supplements should never be installed 
after SLS NET382E has been installed, as this may cause earlier revisions 
of software to over-write later revisions.  The releases of SCO products 
to which this SLS applies are listed at the beginning of this document. 

Should your system already have SCO Global Access installed, or if you
plan to install SCO Global Access at a later date, please see the notes
above regarding SCO Global Access before proceeding with the installation 
of this SLS or SCO Global Access. 

To install SLS NET382E:

1. Shutdown and reboot your system.  Enter System Maintenance 
   mode by typing your root password at the prompt:

   Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
   (or give root password for System Maintenance)

2. Type:

   /etc/custom

3. The main custom "menu" will appear.  The "Install" option will
   be highlighted.  Press <Enter> to select the "Install" option.

4. A list of installed products will appear.  The first item in 
   the list, "A New Product", is highlighted.  Press <Enter> 
   to select "A New Product".

5. Custom will now display your installation options.  By default,
   "Entire Product" is highlighted.  Press <Enter> to select
   "Entire Product".

6. Custom will prompt you to insert "Distribution Floppy 1".  Insert
   the enclosed diskette into the drive and press <Enter> while 
   "Continue" is highlighted. Note that if SLS NET382A, SLS NET382B,
   SLS NET382C, or NET382D is already installed on the system, you 
   will be prompted to verify that you want to install the newer SLS.

7. After extracting some information from the diskette, custom 
   will display information indicating that it is saving several 
   files or will indicate that it is doing an update from a previous
   release of the SLS.  Custom will then once again prompt you to 
   insert volume 1. Press <Enter> while "Continue" is highlighted.

8. Custom may then prompt you for a serial number and activation 
   key.  Enter the appropriate serial number and activation key 
   based on the information displayed on the screen. 

9. After entering the serial number and activation key, you
   will be prompted:

   "Do you wish to relink the kernel now? (y/n)"

   Enter "y" at this prompt.

10. After the relink of the kernel is complete, you will be
    prompted:

    "Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n)"

    Enter "y" at this prompt.

11. Next, you will be prompted:

    "Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)"

    Enter "y" at this prompt.

12. After the kernel environment has been rebuilt, custom 
    will prompt you to "Press any key to continue".
    Press <Enter>.  Custom will then display the message:

    "Checking file permissions...".

13. After completing these steps, you will be returned to the
    main custom menu.  You may quit out of custom at this time. 
    To reboot the system so that the changes take effect, type:

    /etc/reboot

Should you ever need to remove this SLS, do so while in System
Maintenance mode.  Enter the command:

      /etc/custom

Choose the menu selections:

      Remove -> NET382E -> ALL

Follow the directions displayed on the screen to remove the SLS.

During both the installation and removal of this SLS, you are asked to 
relink the kernel.  If you should choose not to do so during the installation 
or removal process, execute the following commands at a later time while in 
System Maintenance mode:

        cd /etc/conf/cf.d
        ./link_unix

To complete installation or removal of this SLS, answer "y" to the questions 
presented and then reboot your system with the command:

        /etc/reboot


USAGE NOTES

Notes for the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) subsystem:

If you install this SLS before configuring PPP, the new PPP drivers will
be installed the next time you run netconfig(ADM) and configure PPP.  If
you install this SLS after configuring PPP, the SLS installation script 
will detect that PPP is already installed and link in the new PPP drivers 
during the installation of the SLS.

To enable the new PPP start-up debug option, add the string "debug" to the 
entry for a particular machine in /etc/ppphosts.  For example, to enable 
the debug option for machine bomb20, whose entry in /etc/ppphosts reads as 
follows:

132.147.144.30 - bomb20 idle=5 tmout=3

add the string "debug" to the line so that it reads as follows:

132.147.144.30 - bomb20 idle=5 tmout=3 debug

As PPP attempts to establish a connection to the machine bomb20, information
regarding the status of various options that are negotiated will now be logged
to the file /usr/adm/syslog.  Similarly, you can add the debug option to lines
that control incoming PPP connections in the /etc/ppphosts file as follows:

*nppp - - idle=5 tmout=3 debug

This will enable logging for incoming PPP connections.  Editing of
/etc/ppphosts is best accomplished while in System Maintenance mode.

If you have any questions regarding this SLS, or the product on which
it is installed, please contact your software supplier.

We appreciate your business.
