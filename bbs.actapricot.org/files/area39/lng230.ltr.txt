Dear Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) lng230 contains PC-NFS server 
support for SCO NFS Release 1.1.0o (stand alone version) and Release 1.1.0m 
(Open Desktop Release 1.0.0y).  SLS lng230 will only install on SCO UNIX 
System V/386 Operating System Release 3.2.

To install this SLS execute the steps listed below.

   1. Log in as root. Ensure that you are in the / (root) directory.
   2. Insert the floppy into the floppy drive. 
   3. Type "/etc/xinstall"
   4. Answer "y" to the question "First Floppy? (y/n)"
   5. The SLS will then install and the appropriate installation messages
      will be displayed. After the installation is complete you will see the
      following message:

         SCO PCNFS SLS Installation Complete

         Next Floppy? (y/n)

      Answer "n" to this question.

SLS lng230 adds /etc/pcnfsd to your system.  The install script edits the
file /etc/nfs such that this daemon will be executed at init(S) time.  The
file /etc/nfs is linked to /etc/rc0.d/K79nfs and /etc/rc2.d/S89nfs.  Before
editing the /etc/nfs file, it will back it up in /usr/lib/custom/save.  If
you have customized /etc/nfs or changed the links to the /etc/rc directories,
then it is possible that this part of the installation may fail. If the
installation fails, you will need to edit by hand the /etc/nfs file such that
it will be executed correctly.  

Here is an example section of code from /etc/nfs:

   # starup the portmapper
	echo " portmap\c"
	portmap
	if [ $? -ne 0 ]
	then
		echo ""
		echo "Troubling starting portmap.  NFS start aborted."
		exit 1
	fi
	# start up pcnfsd daemon
	echo " pcnfsd\c"
	pcnfsd

SLS lng230 also creates a /usr/spool/lp/pcnfs directory so that you may 
set up NFS remote printing. Please see your PC-NFS manual from your vendor 
for instructions. The pcnfs daemon does not support DOS file locking.  This
feature will be added at a later date.

Yours sincerely,


Technical Support Department
