Dear SCO Customer, 

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) xnx292 corrects a hardware
problem that can cause your machine to crash if an attached parallel 
printer is turned off.  The machine may even crash if it receives
unexpected noise on the parallel printer cable.  The error message will 
be similar to:

"Panic: Interrupt from unknown device, vector 2"

This problem only occurs on particular machines that contain a specific
interrupt controller.  It has been seen on Olivetti PCS286 machines and
Hewlett Packard Vectra 386 machines.  However, this SLS may be installed 
on any 286 or 386 machine that exhibits the problem.

To install SLS xnx292, please take the following steps:

(1) Reboot your system and enter System Maintenance mode.

(2) Invoke the /etc/install utility.

(3) When prompted for the first floppy, make sure that SLS xnx292 is in the
    floppy drive and press <Return>.

(4) You will see a message saying that a new driver has been configured into 
    the kernel before the kernel is relinked.

(5) Type "y" at the prompt "Next Floppy? (y/n)".

(6) The installation is now complete.  Reboot your machine to activate the
    new kernel.
  
If you have any questions, please call our SCO Customer Services Department
at (800) 347-4381.  SCO Customer Service is available Monday through Friday,
6:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., Pacific Time.
