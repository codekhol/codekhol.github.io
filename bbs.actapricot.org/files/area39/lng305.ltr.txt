Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) lng305b will provide you
with conformance to the X/Open Portability Guide Issue 3 and to
POSIX 1003.1 for the SCO UNIX System V/386 Development System.

This SLS is for use with the SCO Open Desktop Development System Release 1.0.0,
1.1.0, and SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Development System Version 2.0.

It will install new include files as well as new functions/utilities or ones
whose functionality has been modified.  SLS lng305b can be installed either
before or after MS1.

To install, follow the steps below:

1. Boot/reboot the machine and enter into single-user mode.

   It is required that the user be in single-user mode when installing
   SLS lng305b.  The reason for this is that the SLS supplies a new shared
   library (/shlib/libc_s), and because most utilities are compiled using
   shared libraries, there is potential for problems if the SLS is installed
   in multiuser mode.  SLS lng305b installs a new shared library,
   /shlib/libc_s, which you will need to install in place of the original.
   To do this, SLS lng305b provides a copy of mv which has been compiled
   using archive as opposed to shared libraries.  The new shared library,
   libc_s, is installed into /tmp.  mv then moves the old library to
   /tmp/libc_s.old and the new library to /shlib/libc_s.  All this is
   done automatically by the install script.

2. Insert SLS lng305b into the floppy drive.

3. Use custom to install the files by entering the command:

      custom

4. Choose the option to install "A New Product."

5. Choose the option for "Entire Product."

6. Press <Enter> to continue.

7. Next you will be prompted for a serial number and activation key.
   Enter the serial number and activation key supplied with the SCO
   System V Development System product.

8. Remove the old library in /tmp/libc_s.old.

   In order to remove the /tmp/libc_s.old library from the system, it is first
   necessary to reboot the system, since the invoking shell will still use the
   text image of /tmp/libc_s.old.

     /usr/include/sys/ci/cilock.h


A set of updated archive, shared and link libraries:

     /lib/libc.a
     /lib/libc_s.a
     /lib/libcrypt_i.a
     /lib/libintl.a
     /lib/libm.a

     /usr/bin/dumpmsg
     /usr/bin/mar
     /usr/bin/iconv
     /usr/bin/findstr
     /usr/bin/insertmsg 
     
New compiler pass:

     /lib/386/p2_386

Math Functions:

A number of math functions have changed slightly with regard to return
errors.  The following functions now return HUGE_VAL (instead of HUGE)
if overflow occurs:

       ldexp()
       exp()
       gamma()
       hypot()
       pow()

The following functions now return HUGE_VAL (instead of HUGE) in the case
of negative arguments:

       log()
       j0()
       j1()
       jn()
       sinh().


A number of manual pages are provided for functions whose functionality
has been either added to or modified.  New functions are also documented.
The functions provided as new or added to the SLS are:

       findstr(CP)    find strings in C source code
       gencat(CP)     generates formatted message catalog
       insertmsg(CP)  separate strings from program logic
       catgets(S)     read a program message
       catopen(S)     open or close a message catalog
       fsync(S)       synchronise a file's state
       gamma(S)       log gamma function
       printf(S)      print formatted output
       regexp(S)      regular expression compile and match routines
       scanf(S)       convert formatted input
       sysconf(S)     get configurable system variables
