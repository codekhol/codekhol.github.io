Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) NET371A contains two new
daemons and utilities for SCO NFS Release 1.2.0 and the NFS service of
SCO Open Desktop Release 2.0.

The new utilities and daemons are as follows:

- /etc/pcnfsd

This new /etc/pcnfsd allows PCNFS clients to understand the use of
supplemental groups when accessing files on the SCO NFS server as a user
with a supplemental group vector.  Please note that PCNFS is not supported
on the SCO Open Desktop Personal System, but PCNFS works with both the SCO
Open Desktop Server system, as well as SCO NFS Release 1.2.0 running on SCO
UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.1.

- /etc/yp/ypshad2pwd

This new utility allows NIS password maps to be successfully converted
into the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files when there are more than
76 users in the password map.

Additionally, for users of the SCO NFS Development System Release 1.2.0,
and the NFS component of the SCO Open Desktop Development System Release
2.0, this SLS provides a new RPC library, /usr/lib/librpc.a, that allows
a user other than root to register a service with the portmapper. 

To install SLS NET371A, take the following steps:

	1. Shutdown and reboot your system.  Enter System Maintenance 
	   mode by typing your root password at the prompt:

	   Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
	   (or give root password for system maintenance)

	2. Type:

		   /etc/custom

	3. The main custom "menu" will appear.  The "Install" option will
	   be highlighted.  Press <Return> to select the "Install" option.

	4. A list of installed products will appear.  The first item in 
	   the list, "A New Product", is highlighted.  Press <Return> 
	   to select "A New Product".

	5. Custom will now display your installation options.  By default,
	   "Entire Product" is highlighted.  Press <Return> to select
	   "Entire Product".

	6. Custom will prompt you to insert "Distribution Floppy 1".  Insert
	   the enclosed floppy disk into the drive and press <Return> while 
	   "Continue" is highlighted.

	7. After extracting some information from the floppy disk, custom 
	   will display information indicating that it is saving several 
	   files.  Custom will once again prompt you to insert volume 1.
	   Press <Return> while "Continue" is highlighted.

	8. After extracting several files, custom will display messages
	   indicating that it is installing the new daemon and utility.
	   Custom will then prompt you for a serial number and activation 
	   key.  Enter the appropriate serial number and activation key 
	   based on the information displayed on the screen. 

        9. Custom will prompt you to "Press any key to continue".
	   Press <Return>.  Custom will then display the message:

		"Checking file permissions...".

       10. After completing these steps, you will be returned to the
	   main custom menu.  You may quit out of custom at this time. 
	   To reboot the system so that the changes take effect, type:

	        /etc/reboot

Should you install the SCO NFS Development System Release 1.2.0 or the NFS 
portion of the SCO Open Desktop Development System Release 2.0 at a later 
time, execute the following commands while in System Maintenance mode to 
install the new RPC library that is provided with this SLS:

     copy -om /usr/lib/custom/net371/usr/lib/librpc.a /usr/lib/librpc.a
