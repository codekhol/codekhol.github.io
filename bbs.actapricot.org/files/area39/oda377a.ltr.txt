Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) ODA377A addresses the following
issues:

        1. SLS ODA377A prevents non-root users from gaining root access
           via scosession, scoterm, xterm, and clean_screen.

        2. The logging feature of scoterm and xterm was disabled in
           SCO Open Desktop Release 3.0.  SLS ODA377A re-introduces
           this feature in a secure manner.

SLS ODA377A will install on:

    SCO Open Desktop Release 2.0
    SCO Open Desktop Release 3.0

SLS ODA377A is custom(ADM) installable and removable. 

SLS ODA377A consists of a single floppy volume.
