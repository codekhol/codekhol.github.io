Dear SCO Customer, 

Enclosed is Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx318.  This SLS provides a new
serial driver for SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 
2.0 and SCO Open Desktop Release 1.1 for computers based on Micro Channel 
Architecture (MCA). This new driver addresses problems with system panics 
that may be experienced when using non-intelligent serial multiport cards.  
SLS unx318 should ONLY be applied to systems running SCO UNIX System V/386 
Release 3.2 Operating System Version 2.0 or SCO Open Desktop Release 1.1 for 
computers based on Micro Channel Architecture (MCA).

Following are instructions for the installation of SLS unx318:
