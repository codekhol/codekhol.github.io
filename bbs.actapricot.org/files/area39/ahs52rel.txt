 Chapter 1
 Before installing AHS

_____________________________________________________________________________

    Advanced Hardware Supplement (AHS) Release 5.2.0 provides device drivers
    and documentation to support the latest hardware on SCO OpenServer(TM)
    systems for:

    +  graphics devices

    +  network adapters

    +  mass storage devices

    +  multiprocessing systems

    AHS software and documentation is available on:

    CD-ROM distribution
         You can install the entire AHS 5.2.0 product or individual AHS
         components from the SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.2 CD-ROM
         distribution.

    SCO Online Support
         You can download the entire AHS 5.2.0 product or individual AHS
         components from the SCO Online Support (SOS) system using:

         +  WWW access

         +  ftp

         +  telnet

         +  dial-up access

         See ``Downloading AHS components''.

    Floppy disk distribution
         You can install the entire AHS 5.2.0 product or individual AHS
         components from the AHS Release 5.2.0 floppy disk distribution or
         from disk images downloaded from the SOS system.

         See also ``Creating installation floppy disks''.

    Before installing AHS components, familiarize yourself with:

    +  AHS 5.2.0 system requirements

    +  AHS 5.2.0 system components

    +  SSOs and AHS 5.2.0

    Then, see Chapter  2, ``Installing the AHS 5.2.0 software''.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  After installation, we recommend that you review AHS Features
       and Limitations before configuring individual device drivers.  AHS
       Release and Installation Notes and AHS Features and Limitations are
       installed by default when any AHS 5.2.0 component is installed.
    _________________________________________________________________________

 System requirements

    AHS Release 5.2.0 is supported on these platforms:

    +  SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.2

    +  SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.0d with the Network Maintenance Supplement
       installed

    If AHS Release 5.1.0 is installed on an SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.0d
    system, AHS Release 5.2.0 will update it.

    Installing the entire AHS Release 5.2.0 product requires approximately
    13MB of disk space; the Graphics and Network Drivers components each
    require about 5MB, and the Mass Storage and Multiprocessing components
    together require about 2.5MB.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       WARNING

       +  Do not install AHS Release 5.2.0 on a system that is a server
          for networked operating system installation (initial system
          load, or ISL).  If you do, networked ISLs will no longer be
          possible from that machine.

       +  If you intend to add local language support for SCO OpenServer
          Release 5.0.2, do so before installing AHS Release 5.2.0.  If
          you install language support after installing AHS, screen
          messages and documentation may not correspond to installed
          software.  Reinstalling AHS Release 5.2.0 will correct this
          problem.

    _________________________________________________________________________

 About AHS components

    AHS Release 5.2.0 includes these technology components:

    Graphics Drivers
         Includes graphics drivers, grafinfo files, and moninfo files for all
         supported graphics devices, plus an updated version of the Video
         Configuration Manager, a revised Configuring Video Adapters book,
         and new context-sensitive help for the video configuration software.

         Installing this component will update any configured devices on your
         system.  Additional devices can be configured with the Video
         Configuration Manager after the AHS software is installed.

         See Chapter  1, ``Graphics drivers: features and limitations'' in
         the AHS Features and Limitations.

    Network Drivers
         Includes driver binaries and support files for all supported network
         devices, plus an updated version of the Network Configuration
         Manager, a revised Configuring Network Connections book, and new
         context-sensitive help for the network configuration software.

         Installing this component will update any configured devices on your
         system.  Additional devices can be configured with the Network
         Configuration Manager after the AHS software is installed.

         See Chapter  2, ``Network drivers: features and limitations'' in the
         AHS Features and Limitations.

    Mass Storage Drivers
         Includes driver binaries and support files for SCSI host adapters,
         the SCSI jukebox peripheral drive, the Irwin tape drive, and ESDI
         and WD (EIDE and ATAPI CD-ROM) disk drives.

         The boot-time loadable drivers (BTLDs) that are included in the Mass
         Storage Drivers component can be installed directly at boot time
         using the link(HW) or ahslink commands; see ``Using BTLDs at
         installation time''.

         _________________________________________________________________________
            NOTE  See ``Creating a BTLD disk'' if you are downloading the
            Mass Storage Drivers component and you want to use a boot-time
            loadable driver BTLD at installation time.
         _________________________________________________________________________

         See Chapter  3, ``Mass storage drivers: notes and limitations'' in
         the AHS Features and Limitations.

    Multiprocessing Drivers
         Software to support the Tricord PowerFrame and APIC (Intel MPS)
         platforms.

         See Chapter  4, ``Multiprocessing drivers: notes and limitations''
         in the AHS Features and Limitations.

    AHS Base Documentation and Tools
         Provides support for other AHS components.  Do not select this
         component for installation; it is automatically installed by the
         other components that require it.  Selecting this component installs
         only documentation.

 About SSOs and AHS releases

    AHS Release 5.2.0 components use the SCO OpenServer software storage
    object (SSO) architecture.  For SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.0, each of
    these components was contained in a single SSO.  In subsequent AHS
    releases, these large SSOs are replaced by a collection of smaller SSOs
    to allow for more modular upgrades in future releases.  The Graphics and
    Network Drivers were reorganized in AHS Release 5.1.0, and the Mass
    Storage Drivers were reorganized in AHS Release 5.2.0.

    You will not be affected by this SSO reorganization if you are installing
    AHS Release 5.2.0 components as an entire product or a technology
    component.
    If you install a single driver package, you must first install the
    appropriate configuration tool:

    Video Configuration Manager
         for the Graphics Drivers component

    Network Configuration Manager
         for the Network Drivers component

    AHS Base Documentation and Tools
         for the Mass Storage Drivers Component

    _________________________________________________________________________
       WARNING  If you install the AHS Release 5.2.0 graphics or network
       single driver packages on SCO OpenServer systems without AHS
       Release 5.1.0 installed and without first installing the
       appropriate configuration tool, you will remove existing drivers of
       that technology.

       You will lose configuration information:

       +  when you update the Network Configuration Manager.

       +  if you install graphics or network single driver packages when
          two or more drivers are configured in the system.  Configuration
          information will be lost for at least one of the drivers.

       If you need to install single driver packages under these
       conditions, write down your network configuration information
       before installing new drivers.

       The mass storage drivers are not affected by these problems.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    The Multiprocessing Drivers component is not affected by the SSO
    reorganization, so single driver packages can be installed from this
    component on all supported platforms.

 Downloading AHS components

    To download AHS components or the entire AHS product from the SCO Online
    Support (SOS) system:

    1.  Create a /tmp/ahs5_2 directory (or other directory of your choice)
        and change directories to it:

           mkdir /tmp/ahs5_2
           cd /tmp/ahs5_2

    2.  Download AHS components using one of these methods:

        +  WWW access

        +  ftp

        +  telnet

        +  dialup access

    3.  Install the AHS components you downloaded according to the
        instructions in Chapter  2, ``Installing the AHS 5.2.0 software''.
        The components will appear as ``media images'' on the local host
        during the installation process.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  It is not necessary to transfer downloaded AHS disk images to
       floppy disk before installing the components.  Doing so will
       considerably lengthen the installation process.  However, if you
       need to install AHS components from floppy disks, see ``Creating
       installation floppy disks''.

       If you are downloading BTLD components and you want to use a BTLD
       at installation time, you must first create a BTLD floppy disk. See
       ``Creating a BTLD disk''.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    For more information about the SCO Online Support (SOS) system, see ``SCO
    Online Support'' in the introduction to the printed version of the SCO
    OpenServer Release Notes.  Also, consult the README files included in SOS
    system directories before downloading AHS components.

 WWW

    To download AHS components from the SCO World Wide Web (WWW) site, point
    your WWW browser (such as scohelp, Netscape, or NCSA Mosaic) to this URL
    (Uniform Resource Locator):

       http://www.sco.com/

    To access current information about AHS and other SCO support services,
    click on ``Services.''

 ftp

    To download AHS components using anonymous ftp(TC):

    1.  Establish an ftp connection by entering:

           ftp -i ftp.sco.com

    2.  Log in as anonymous, giving your e-mail address for the password.

    3.  Enter:

           cd AHS

    4.  After consulting READMEs for current information, download the
        desired components and exit ftp.

 telnet

    To download AHS components using telnet(TC):

    1.  Establish a telnet connection by entering:

           telnet SOS.sco.com

    2.  After entering the appropriate terminal type, select ``Toolchest''
        from the SOS system menu, then ``AHS.''

    3.  After consulting the ``List'' to determine the files you need, follow
        the menu instructions to download files.

        When you enter the name of a file, you will be given a list of
        transfer protocols.  Depending on the transfer protocol selected, you
        may be required to enter a receive command before proceeding.

    4.  After when downloading is complete, return to the main menu and exit.

 Dial-up connections

    When downloading from the SOS system using a dialup modem line, two
    choices are available:

    +  an interactive login from a DOS-based PC, followed by download via the
       XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM, or KERMIT protocols

    +  a non-interactive download using UUCP file transfer protocol from an
       SCO system (probably the machine on which the AHS software is to be
       installed)

    Downloading from a DOS-based PC

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  You must have a serial communication package that includes
       one of the following transfer protocols:

       +  XMODEM

       +  XMODEM-1K

       +  YMODEM

       +  ZMODEM

       +  kermit (binary mode)
    _________________________________________________________________________

    To download AHS components using dial-up connections:

    1.  Use your modem and communications software to call either the US or
        the UK, depending on location:

        For the US site:
          (408) 426-9495 (for 300 to 14.4K baud modems).
          (408) 426-9525 (if you have a Telebit modem, 19.2K or lower)

        For the UK site:
          +44 (0) 1923 210 888 (up to 2,400 baud)

    2.  After a welcome message, enter sos when prompted for an SOS login.

    3.  Set your terminal type or choose line-by-line mode.
    4.  At the SOS system menu, select ``Toolchest,'' then ``AHS.''

    5.  After consulting the ``List'' to determine the files you need, choose
        ``Download'' and enter the name of the file to be downloaded.

        You will then be given the list of transfer protocols mentioned
        above. Depending on the transfer protocol selected, you may be
        required to enter a receive command before downloading proceeds.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  Some of the download protocols transmit the filename
           along with the file data.  Since some of the filenames on the
           SOS system are not compatible with DOS filename conventions,
           this may cause the download to fail.  To work around this
           problem, use a protocol such as XMODEM that does not transmit
           the filename, giving you the opportunity to manually enter a
           different name.
        _________________________________________________________________________

    6.  When downloading is complete, copy the file to a floppy disk.

    7.  Use doscp(C) to copy the file to the SCO OpenServer target machine
        and convert it to a UNIX file by entering:

           doscp -r DOS.files .

        The -r option prevents newline conversions and forces a true byte
        copy, regardless of file type.

    Downloading from an SCO system using UUCP

    1.  After configuring your modem for dialing out, configure UUCP
        recognize the SCO system that contains the files.  Add one of the
        following lines to the end of the Systems configuration file in the
        directory /usr/lib/uucp (if they do not already exist):

        +  v.32 compatible modem:
           sosco Any ACU Any 14084253502 -\r\d-ogin:-\K\d-ogin:-\K\d-ogin:
           uusls

        +  Telebit modem (PEP mode only):
           sosco Any ACU Any 14084291786 -\r\d-ogin:-\K\d-ogin:-\K\d-ogin:
           uusls

    2.  Once the system is configured, use the uucp(C) command to request
        files from the remote system.  All files for AHS Release 5.2.0 reside
        in /usr/spool/uucppublic/AHS/5.0/sco/5.2.

        First, download the README for a list of files and other relevant
        information:

        uucp  sosco!/usr/spool/uucppublic/AHS/5.0/sco/5.2/README  /tmp/README

    3.  Download other files as necessary.

        If you are using the C shell command interpreter, you must enter a
        backslash character (\) before the exclamation mark (``!'')  to
        prevent the C shell history mechanism from intercepting the rest of
        the command line.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  In general, a local directory other than /tmp is not
           accessible using UUCP for downloading without configuring the
           /usr/lib/uucp/Permissions file.  See the uucp(C) manual page
           about downloading directly to local directories.
        _________________________________________________________________________

 Creating installation floppy disks

    To create a set of floppy disks for installing AHS:

    1.  If the AHS software is not yet accessible (on a local or remote
        machine), download media images according to the instructions in
        ``Downloading AHS components''

    2.  Copy the media images to formatted floppy disks using the dd(C)
        command, for example:

           dd if=/image_directory/images of=/dev/rfd0

        The directory containing the media images will be located on your
        CD-ROM or in a directory on a hard disk (such as /tmp/ahs5_2.

    3.  Install AHS components according to the instructions in ``Installing
        from floppy disks''.

 Creating a BTLD disk

    If you downloaded mass storage drivers and you want to use a BTLD driver
    at installation time, you must create a BTLD disk to use as your boot
    disk.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  If you have the AHS Release 5.2.0 CD-ROM distribution, you do
       not need to create a BTLD disk; one is included with the
       distribution.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    To create a BTLD disk:

    1.  Download the media image marked ``BTLD disk''.

    2.  Copy the media image to a formatted floppy disk using the dd(C)
        command, for example:

           dd if=/tmp/ahs5_2/btld_disk_image of=/dev/rfd0

    3.  Use the BTLD disk as your boot disk as described in ``Using BTLDs at
        installation time''.

              may remove previously configured drivers.  See ``About SSOs
              and AHS releases''.
           _________________________________________________________________________

    5.  When the installation is complete, select Exit from the Host menu.

    6.  When the system prompt returns, you can delete the AHS Release 5.2.0
        volume image files from your system if they are not required for
        other installations.

    7.  If the kernel was relinked, you must reboot your system for the
        changes to take effect.  Type init 6, then press <Enter> to reboot
        your system.

    When the system comes up, the new drivers are installed.

 Installing from floppy disks

    To install AHS software from floppy disks:

    1.  Create a set of floppy disks according to instructions in ``Creating
        installation floppy disks'' if you do not already have a set.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  We recommend that you copy your AHS media images from
           floppy disks to your hard drive before installing AHS software.
           To do so, use the dd(C) command, for example:

              dd if=/dev/rfd0 of=/tmp/ahs5_2/VOL.00N.000

           The volume names must correspond exactly to the media image
           names (N is a number from 0-5).  Then install AHS software
           according to the instructions in ``Installing from downloaded
           files''.  Doing so will significantly simplify and shorten the
           installation procedure.
        _________________________________________________________________________

    2.  As root, run the Software Manager from the desktop, or enter scoadmin
        software from the command line.

    3.  Select Install New from the Software menu.

    4.  Select the current host and specify the correct Floppy Disk Drive.
        Insert your floppy disk and click on Continue.

        +  To install the entire AHS product, click on Full.

        +  To install a single technology or single drivers, click on
           Partial.  Then select the components you want from the list of
           available software and click on Install.  The components are
           described in ``About AHS components''.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           CAUTION  Installing single driver or documentation packages may
           remove previously configured drivers.  See ``About SSOs and AHS
           releases''.
        _________________________________________________________________________

    6.  When the installation is complete, select Exit from the Host menu.

    7.  If the kernel was relinked, you must reboot your system for the
        changes to take effect.  Type init 6, then press <Enter> to reboot
        your system.

    When the system comes up, the new drivers are installed.  Store the
    floppy disks in a safe place.

 Installing BTLD and mass storage drivers

    The mass storage boot-time loadable drivers (BTLD) included with AHS
    Release 5.2.0 are:

    alad  Adaptec 7870 and 7850 Host Adapter Driver; see alad(AHS)

    ams   Advanced Micro Devices; see ams(AHS)

    arad  Adaptec 7770 Host Adapter Driver; see arad(AHS)

    blc   BusLogic SCSI Driver; see blc(AHS)

    dptr  DPT - entire card line; see dptr(AHS)

    esdi  IBM Fixed Disk Adapter/A; see esdi(AHS)

    iiop  Tricord ES5000 Motherboards; see iiop(AHS)

    slha  Symbios Logic Host Adapter Driver; see slha(AHS)

    smad  Adaptec AIC-6x60 Host Adapter Driver; see smad(AHS)

    wd    EIDE Driver; see wd(AHS)

    The Sjk SCSI device (SCSI jukebox driver) and Irwin (mc) tape driver
    cannot be linked at boot time.  Instead, use the Software Manager as
    described in ``Installing from the CD-ROM distribution'', ``Installing
    from downloaded files'', or ``Installing from floppy disks''.

    There are two scenarios in which you might need to install the Mass
    Storage Drivers component:

    +  To install new hardware that is required for your system at
       installation time, you may need to add one of the drivers included in
       the Mass Storage Drivers component before you can install the
       operating system.  See ``Using BTLDs at installation time''.

    +  To install new hardware after installing the operating system, the
       Mass Storage Drivers component is treated as a package of drivers that
       are added to the Link Kit by the Software Manager.  See ``Installing
       from the CD-ROM distribution'', ``Installing from downloaded files'',
       or ``Installing from floppy disks''.

       _________________________________________________________________________
          NOTE  BTLD drivers installed at ISL are not visible to the
          Software Manager even though they are installed in the link kit.
          It is possible to custom-install a driver that has already been
          BTLD-installed and this may become recommended practice in
          future releases of AHS.
       _________________________________________________________________________

    See ``Installing over previously-installed BTLDs'' if you are updating a
    previously-installed BTLD driver.

    After installing a driver, read the manual page for that driver.
    Driver-specific manual pages in the AHS section contain configuration
    notes and known limitations for the individual drivers.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  If you installed individual drivers from the SCO Online
       Support system, only documentation for the installed drivers is
       available on your system.
    _________________________________________________________________________

 Using BTLDs at installation time

    This section describes how to install the new driver which is required
    for the installation of the SCO OpenServer system.  If you need to use
    your BTLD disk at installation time, you should have already inserted
    your boot disk.  After inserting the boot disk, the boot prompt is
    displayed; this is the point at which you begin the installation
    procedure for this SCO BTLD package.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  If you downloaded BTLDs from the SOS system, you must first
       create a BTLD disk; see ``Creating a BTLD disk''.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    At this stage, the boot floppy disk should be in the drive, and the
    system displays:

    SCO OpenServer(tm) Release 5

    Boot
    :

    1.  What you enter at the ``:''prompt depends on the driver you are
        installing:

        ams, slha, or iiop drivers
             Enter link at the ``:'' prompt.

        alad, arad, dptr, esdi or wd drivers
             Enter ahslink.

        smad driver
             Enter defbootstr link disable=spad (the smad driver replaces the
             older spad driver).

        blc driver
             Enter defbootstr link disable=ad (the blc adapter may be
             mistaken for the ad driver).
        If you are installing more than one driver, enter the link commands
        that are appropriate for your drivers:

           defbootstr link="driver_name other-btld"
           defbootstr ahslink="driver_name other-btld"

    2.  At the prompt, enter only the packages that are required by the
        installation. To install the other packages on the disk, use the
        post-installation procedure as described in ``Installing from the
        CD-ROM distribution'', ``Installing from downloaded files'', or
        ``Installing from floppy disks''.

        Next, you see a boot line similar to the following:

        fd(64)unix ramdisk=f(64) rootfs root=ram(7) ram.preload=7 swap=none
        dump=none nbuf=100 link=pkg btld=fd(x)

        Memory found: 0k - 640k, 1m - 9600k

        pkg in the line above is replaced by the actual name of the driver
        package for boot-time loading and x is replaced by the minor number
        for your floppy device.

        After a moment, a series of prompts are displayed with trailing dots;
        these messages progress as software is loaded.

    3.  Insert the requested volume (the SCO BTLD disk) when prompted. The
        system prompts for and extracts the contents of the package.

        If the wrong volume is inserted or the drive is empty, the system
        displays the following:

        Sorry, that volume does not contain the pkg package

    4.  link(HW) and ahslink perform the linking of the extracted drivers
        into the kernel and might require more information for the extracted
        drivers.  If the system prompts you for more information about
        configuring in these drivers, refer to the link(HW) manual page.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  If there are any errors during this extraction (linking)
           process, the process is aborted and you are forced to reboot.
        _________________________________________________________________________

    5.  After a series of messages culminating in a notice that your driver
        loaded successfully, you will see a message prompting you to re-
        insert the boot disk.

        _________________________________________________________________________
           NOTE  You can safely ignore the following message if it
           appears:

           ... Characteristic '...' not supported;

        _________________________________________________________________________

        The Mass Storage Drivers component has been installed, and you return
        to the installation procedure for SCO OpenServer.

        During the installation of the SCO OpenServer system you will be
        asked whether you want to customize your operating system.  At the
        very least, you must install the SCO OpenServer Run Time System (RTS)
        and the BASE and LINK packages of the SCO OpenServer Extended
        Utilities.

 Installing over previously-installed BTLDs

    If a different version of a driver with the same name as an AHS driver is
    found during installation using the Software Manager, you will be
    prompted to keep the driver already installed or overwrite it with the
    AHS version.

    If you answer yes to overwrite the driver, the third-party driver and its
    configuration information is overwritten.  However, the new AHS driver
    will not be configured into the kernel.  You will need to turn on the
    driver by changing `N' in the driver's entry in /etc/conf/sdevice.d to
    `Y'.  Relink the kernel before rebooting.

 Installing multiprocessing drivers

    Before installing the multiprocessing component, you must have:

    +  The SCO OpenServer system installed with SCO Symmetrical
       Multiprocessing Support (SMP(r)).  This product can be found on the
       original installation media tape or CD-ROM and accessed using the
       Software Manager).

    +  If you are installing the Tricord PowerFrame (TPF) package, you must
       have already installed and configured the iiop BTLD package.  If it is
       not, the MP component will be installed, but the TPF driver will be
       disabled.  In this case, install the iiop package, then enable the TPF
       driver by changing the setting the second field of the
       /etc/conf/sdevice.d/tpf file from N to Y.  For information about
       installing the iiop package, see ``Using BTLDs at installation time''.

    You can install on one of the following configurations:

    +  a clean distribution (SCO OpenServer and no MP drivers)

    +  a distribution which already has a vendor EFS (it is not generally
       necessary to remove the EFS prior to installing the SCO Multi-
       processing Drivers Release 5.2.0)

    The AHS Multiprocessing Drivers component can be removed and any vendor
    EFS or SCO OpenServer files will be restored (if you want to save them).

    To install AHS Multiprocessing Drivers components, see ``Installing from
    the CD-ROM distribution'', ``Installing from downloaded files'', or
    ``Installing from floppy disks''.

 Chapter 3
 Removing the AHS software

_____________________________________________________________________________

    The Advanced Hardware Supplement (AHS) Release 5.2.0 software is not
    normally removed once it is installed from the system and full roll-back
    capability is not supported.  The software can be removed using the
    Software Manager, but you will then need to reinstall portions of
    software from the original SCO OpenServer Release 5 media.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       WARNING  The system should be in system maintenance mode when
       removing and restoring AHS software.  Specifically, be sure that no
       NFS automounts are active when removing these components.  During
       the removal process, TCP will be deconfigured, which can cause
       problems if there are active NFS mounts.
    _________________________________________________________________________

    To remove AHS Release 5.2.0 software:

    1.  As root, enter the following to bring your machine into system
        maintenance mode:

           /etc/shutdown -i1

    2.  In the Software Manager, select SCO Advanced Hardware Supplement from
        the list of installed software, then select Remove from the Software
        menu.  Click on OK to confirm the removal.

    3.  Select Exit from the Host menu.  AHS Release 5.2.0 software has now
        been removed.

    _________________________________________________________________________
       NOTE  If you remove a large number of drivers from an SCO
       OpenServer Release 5.0.0 system using the Software Manager or you
       allow the Software Manager to run for an extended period, the
       removal procedure may fail with a cannot fork process message.
       This is caused by a known memory problem with the Software Manager.
       To work around this problem, restart the Software Manager and
       remove drivers in smaller groups, restarting the Software Manager
       if necessary.
    _________________________________________________________________________

 Restoring software after removing AHS Release 5.2.0

    After removing the Graphics Drivers or Network Drivers packages from AHS
    Release 5.2.0 as described in Chapter  3, ``Removing the AHS software'',
    you will need to restore files from the original SCO OpenServer Release 5
    release media to return your system to the state it was in before
    installing the AHS software.

    1.  From the list of available software in the Software Manager, record
        which SCO OpenServer Release 5 system you are using (Enterprise,
        Host, or Desktop).

    2.  Select Install New from the Software menu.  Select the current host,
        identify the media device (tape or CD-ROM), and insert your original
        SCO OpenServer Release 5 distribution media.

    3.  The media contains several SCO products.  Select the SCO OpenServer
        Release 5 system that you already have installed (recorded from the
        main window of the Software Manager).

    4.  Specify a Partial installation, then:

        +  restore the Graphics Drivers by expanding  the SCO OpenServer
           Graphics item and selecting Graphics Drivers.

        +  restore the Network Drivers by expanding  the SCO OpenServer
           Connectivity item and selecting Network Drivers.

    5.  Click on the Install button.  The Software Manager will install just
        these two components, restoring your system to the original SCO
        OpenServer Release 5 versions.

    6.  Reconfigure your network and graphics software using the:

        +  Video Configuration Manager; see Chapter  1, ``Configuring video
           adapters'' in Configuring Video Adapters.

        +  Network Configuration Manager; see Chapter  1, ``Configuring
           network connections'' in Configuring Network Connections.
