Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) UOD368B provides a new passwd(C)
utility which addresses two problems:

	1. A problem where using the -l (or -u) option causes the user's
	   account to be removed from the system.  This applies to all 
	   systems listed below.

	2. A problem where a user with "auth" privilege's can change his/her
	   own password without being prompted for the old one first. This 
	   does not apply to SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating
	   System Version 2.0 or SCO Open Desktop Release 1.1.x.

SLS UOD368B will install on:

    SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 2.0, 4.0, 4.2 
    SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.0 with
      Maintenance Supplement Version 4.1/4.2
    SCO Open Desktop Release 1.1.x, 2.0 and 3.0

SLS UOD368B is custom(ADM) installable and removable. 

SLS UOD368B consists of a single floppy volume.
