Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx304 provides conformance to 
the X/Open Portability Guide Issue 3 (XPG3) and to POSIX 1003.1 for the SCO 
UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 2.0.

It is for use with both the SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System
Version 2.0 and SCO Open Desktop Release 1.1.

To install SLS unx304, take the following steps:

1. Boot/reboot the machine and enter single user mode.

2. Insert SLS unx304 into the floppy drive.

3. Use custom to install the files by entering the command:

        custom

4. Choose the option to install a new product.

It is important that the user is in single-user mode when installing SLS 
unx304.  The main reason for this is that this SLS supplies a new shared 
library (/shlib/libc_s), and because most utilities are compiled using shared
libraries, there is potential for problems if the SLS is installed in multi-
user mode.  In order to install the new shared library correctly, SLS unx304
provides a copy of mv (/tmp/mv) which has been compiled using archive as 
opposed to shared libraries.  The new libc_s is initially installed under 
/tmp and the new mv is used to move the old /shlib/libc_s to /tmp/libc_s.old
and the new libc_s (in /tmp/libc_s) to /shlib/libc_s.  All this is done for 
you by the install script.

5. Remove the old library in /tmp/libc_s.old.

In order to remove /tmp/libc_s.old from the system, it will be necessary to 
reboot the machine first.  This is because the invoking shell will still be 
using the text image of /tmp/libc_s.old until the machine is rebooted.


This SLS supplies a set of locale files (under /usr/lib/lang) which define the 
C locale, as defined by the X/Open Portability Guide Issue 3.  The default 
language file (/etc/default/lang) is modified automatically during the 
installation to insert the following line:

    LANG=C_C.C

Before the line is added, the user will be asked the question:

    Do you want the C language to be the system default?

If the user replies "y", the C locale will become the default for any program 
(as per the XPG3 standard).  Should the user reply "n", the default locale of 
the system will not be altered, but the C locale will be available to programs 
that request it, for example, by setting the environment variable LANG or 
using setlocale().

Notes

The utility ptar(C) is a POSIX and XPG3 conforming version of the utility 
tar(C).  It has been updated to become fully XPG3 conformant.

The utility cpio(C) has been updated.  Now, when it is used to copy files by 
a process without appropriate privileges, the access permissions are set in 
the same fashion that creat() would have set them when given the "mode" 
argument, matching the file permissions supplied by the "c_mode" field of the 
cpio format.

login(M) and su(C) now start the shell with the supplemental group list set. 
The supplemental group ID list is used in addition to the effective group ID 
(EGID) in determining file access permissions.  The EGID is still used in file 
creation.  The maximum number of groups in the supplemental groups list is 
defined by the tunable kernel parameter NGROUPS_MAX.

It can be changed by running sysadmsh(ADM), selecting
System->Configure->Kernel->Parameters and selecting option 3, 
"Files, Inodes, and Filesystems". The parameter is NGROUPS.

login and su set the supplemental group list to the login GID 
(from /etc/passwd), followed by successive groups (read from /etc/group) 
of which the user is a member (excluding the login group). If a user is 
listed as a member of a group more than once, the group ID will appear 
more than once in the supplemental group list.  When the list is full, 
or the end of the group file is reached, the supplemental group list is 
set.

This behaviour is functionally equivalent to BSD's, except that BSD     
uses a fixed, instead of configurable, size list.

The utilities fsck(ADM) and coltbl(M) have been updated to include 
a number of enhancements.
