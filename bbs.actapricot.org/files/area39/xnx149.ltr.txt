4. Base Address              0H        i/o addresses start here

You will be asked to:

     Enter a parameter to modify or 'q' to return to the main menu

Enter a value for each of the four categories listed above.  Included here
are some basic explanations of each category:

(1) Controller Type
    ===============

What kind of tape drive/controller is being installed?  The values 
correspond to the following:

type A (type 1) = Archive 
type W (type 3) = Wangtek
type E (type 4) = Emerald
type M (type 5) = Mountain
type T (type 6) = Tecmar
type X (type 7) = Everex

With the Tecmar/Wangtek AT Single Chip Qic-02 Host Adaptor, you can use
either type "T" or type "W."


(2) DMA Channel
    ===========

What is the Direct Memory Access (DMA) Channel that is being used?
The choices are DMA Channel 1 or DMA Channel 3.  On a typical tape   
controller card, you will have a set of jumper pins for DACK and 
another set for DRQ.  Each of these should have three pairs of pins
labeled 1, 2, and 3.  The DACK and DRQ pins should each be jumpered
for the appropriate value (1 or 3) as they combine to give you your DMA
value.  In other words, if you want a DMA value of 3, you should jumper
DACK for 3 and DRQ for 3.  Either DMA 1 or 3 are acceptable and neither
provides any particular advantage over the other.


(3) Interrupt Vector
    ================

What is the interrupt value being used?  On a tape controller card, there
will be an IRQ set of jumper pins, typically labeled 2 - 7.  You can use
any interrupt you choose, as long as it is not being used by another
device on your system.  Standard interrupts are as follows:

Interrupt         Used For
---------         --------
    0             Clock
    1             Console
    2 (25)        Network Cards
    3             Serial COM2
    4             Serial COM1
    5             Parallel LP2
    6             Floppy Drive
    7             Parallel LP0 or LP1

Never use interrupts 0,1, or 6, as they are always used for standard
devices on your system.  The rest are potentially available, unless
devices that typically use them are installed on your system.  For
example, if you have a COM1 serial port on your system and it is
recognized on the SCO XENIX boot screen, then interrupt 4 is not an
available interrupt, unless you disable your COM1 port.  The rule of
thumb is that if a device is recognized by SCO XENIX on the boot screen,
the interrupt it uses is taken even if you are not actively using the 
device.  In this case, you must either use another free interrupt, or
physically disable the device which is using the interrupt you want to
use for the tape controller.

The most commonly available interrupts are 2 and 5, as most systems do
not come standard with an LP2 port or a network card.  Be aware that if
you do choose to use interrupt 2, you need to indicate a value of 25
when asked for the "Interrupt Vector" in the "mkdev tape" program.  This
is the only case where a value other the actual value is given.

When you determine what interrupt you will be using, jumper the appropriate
IRQ pins on your tape controller card and then indicate the same value
(except in the case of interrupt 2 where you should indicate 25), in the
"mkdev tape" program.


(4) Base Address
    ============

What is the I/O address that your tape controller card is configured for?
A typical tape controller card will have either jumper pins or switches
for configuring the address.  Check your tape hardware documentation to
determine what the available address settings are.  Again, SCO XENIX does
not really care what address you are using, as long as it is not being
used by another device on your system.  This is not usually an issue, as
common tape controller addresses are not often used by other devices.

After setting an address (or finding out what has already been set) on 
your tape controller card, indicate the same address in the "mkdev tape"
program.  You should always enter the address with a preceeding "0" and
a succeeding "H."  For example, if your address is 300 (hexadecimal), you
should indicate "0300H" in the "mkdev tape" program.


After indicating your four values in "mkdev tape," quit out of the menus
and you will see the message:

     You must create a new kernel to effect the driver change you specified.
     Do you wish to create a new kernel now? (y/n)

Choose "y" and you will see the message:

     Re-linking the kernel...

This will take a moment and then you will be asked:

     Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n)

Answer "y" and when you receive a root prompt, type:

     /etc/haltsys

to reboot your system and activate the new kernel with the tape driver
linked in.

Your original kernel has been renamed "xenix.old."  If you ever need to
boot your original kernel, after a system crash for example, just type
"xenix.old" at the "boot:" prompt.


Setting Up Your Tar and Backup Default Files 
============================================

(1) /etc/default/tar
    ---------------- 

There is a default file for tar that is very useful for writing to tape
devices.  To make use of it, edit the file to indicate what size your 
tape is.  The default file is "/etc/default/tar."  An example is included 
below:


#	@(#) def96.src 1.5 88/05/27 
#	 device     		block   size	tape
archive0=/dev/rfd048ds9		18	360	n	
archive1=/dev/rfd148ds9		18	360	n
archive2=/dev/rfd096ds15	10	1200	n
archive3=/dev/rfd196ds15	10	1200	n
archive4=/dev/rfd096ds9		18	720	n
archive5=/dev/rfd196ds9		18	720	n
archive6=/dev/rfd0135ds18	18	1440	n
archive7=/dev/rfd1135ds18	18	1440	n
archive8=/dev/rct0		20	0	y
archive9=/dev/rctmini		20	0	y
# The default device in the absence of a numeric or "-f device" argument
archive=/dev/rfd096ds15		10	1200	n


Notice that the device "/dev/rct0" for cartridge tapes already exists
within the "/etc/default/tar" file.  You need to go into the file
with an editor (/bin/vi for example) and put in a size for the 
"/dev/rct0" entry.  The size should be stated in 1 Kilobyte blocks,
so that for a 60 Megabyte drive the size would be 60000 and your entry
would look like the following:

     archive8=/dev/rct0              20      60000   y

The reason this is useful is that it greatly simplifies your tar command
because the default file provides a device name, a blocking factor and
a tape size.  Thus, your tar command can be condensed to the following:

     tar cv8 /etc

Again, a 60 Megabyte tape drive  and the "/etc" directory has been used
as an example.  As you can see, simply using the "8" acts as a pointer to
the default file, so that you don't need to specify as much on the 
command line.  To list your tape after writing to the tape drive, the
command would be:

     tar tv8

and to extract your files the command would be:

     tar xv8 /etc

which would bring over the whole "/etc" directory from tape, or as a
variation, you can specify any particular file.  For example, your command
could be:

     tar xv8 /etc/termcap


(2) /etc/default/archive
    --------------------

Another very useful file, "/etc/default/archive" is used by "sysadmin," a
menu driven "front end" to the command "/etc/backup."  Again, all you need
to do is edit the file "/etc/default/archive" and indicate a size for the
"/dev/rct0" entry.  The "/etc/default/archive" file entry for a cartridge
tape drive using a standard 600 foot tape is included below:


#	@(#) archive.src 1.6 88/03/21 
#
#	Copyright (C) The Santa Cruz Operation, 1986.
#	This Module contains Proprietary Information of
#	The Santa Cruz Operation, Microsoft Corporation
#	and AT&T, and should be treated as Confidential.
#

cdev=/dev/rct0 desc="Cartridge Drive (600 ft tape)"	\
blocking=20 size=600 density=20000


The actual file on your system will have many entries for various floppy
devices as well.  You will need to locate the above entry in the file.
Again, using a 60 Megabyte tape drive as our example, your edited entry
should look like the following:

cdev=/dev/rct0 desc="Cartridge Drive (600 ft tape)"      \
blocking=20 size=60000


NOTE:  It is recommended that you use somewhat less than the full tape
====   capacity when you indicate a size.  This is to compensate for
       potential bad spots on the physical tape that need to be mapped
       out.  The following values are recommended:
    
          60 Megabyte =  59000
         125 Megabyte = 123000 
         150 Megabyte = 148000

Yours sincerely,
