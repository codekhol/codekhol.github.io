               SCO UNIX 3.2v2 Maintenance Supplement and UNX340


SCO have produced a major supplement to their existing 3.2v2.0 release of the 
UNIX operating system. Whilst 3.2v4.0 will ship within the next 3 months, this 
supplement updates existing systems at no charge with a number of changes.   
Installation of this supplement  on any new 3.2v2 installations will take care 
of all existing fixes which Apricot routinely advises to be installed. 

To summarise the Maintenance Supplement includes or supercedes:-

    1.  UNX257 Security Enhancement

    2.  UNX251 Kernel Locking/Inode supplement for ISA bus machines

    3.  UNX279 Kernel Supplement for ISA bus machines

    4.  UNX304 X/Open Portability Guide release 3 compatibility.

    5.  EFS102 Scoterm Supplement for SCO XSight

    6.  Double Panic fix also known as the console driver fix.

The supplement must only be installed on 3.2v2.0 systems.  A system which runs 
3.2.0 revision of UNIX must not have this supplement installed until a full 
3.2v2 operating system has replaced the 3.2.0. 

The following items have been extracted as features of this supplement:-

    1.  Enhanced security handling and recovery including  removal and 
        unretiring of users 

    2.  Introduction of "hushlogin" to prevent copyright and  other messages 
        during login. Works with TCP/IP. 

    3.  Allows minimum password length to be more easily controlled.

    4.  Heavy serial line input no longer hangs the machine.

    5.  Console keyboard handling anomalies corrected.

    6.  NFS performance optimisation.

    7.  Double Panic fix as notified above.

    8.  Allows su to work to other than root logins.

Unfortunately a minor error exists with the Maintenance Supplement  involving 
/bin/login.  To remedy this issue UNX340 should be custom installed before 
taking the system multi-user but after  rebooting on the new 3.2v2.1 kernel 
built from the Maintenance Supplement installation. 

The Maintenance Supplement consists of three HD 3.5" diskettes and UNX340 uses 
one DD 3.5" diskette.
