Dear Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement(SLS), xnx116, corrects problems 
with the mapkey program used in the SCO XENIX 386 Operating System
Release 2.3.0 and 2.3.1. The SLS may be installed using the command 
etc/install. In order to do so, the Link Kit must be installed. If the Link
Kit is not installed on your system, or if you are not sure, refer to the 
section on custom(C) in your SCO XENIX System V Operating System User's
Reference Manual. 

To install the fix, it is necessary to go to single user mode. Login
as root and run the commands:

          cd /
          etc/intstall
          type y at the prompt for the first floppy.
          type y to continue with the installation 
          type n at the prompt for the second floppy.

Yours sincerely,


Technical Support Department
