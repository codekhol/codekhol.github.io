    Dear SCO Customer,
    
    Enclosed is the Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx235 Custom(ADM) Update
    with installation instructions. This SLS is designed to install only on 
    SCO UNIX System V/386 Operating System Release 3.2.0.  SLS unx235 updates
    the binaries that custom(ADM) uses so that it may install later versions 
    of SCO products, such as SCO TCP/IP Release 1.1.1b.  This SLS replaces 
    the following binaries:
    
    /usr/bin/tar /usr/bin/compress /usr/bin/uncompress /etc/conf/bin/idtune
    
    The old versions of these binaries will be saved in the directory
    /usr/lib/custom/save.
    
    To install the floppy:
    
       1. Log in as root and ensure that you are located in the / (root)
	  directory.
    
       2. Type the command: 
       
	       /etc/xinstall
	  
	  Answer "y" to the first floppy.
    
	  Installation messages will appear on the screen. 
    
	  The installation will be finished when you see the following
	  message:
    
	     SCO unx235 Custom(ADM) Update SLS Installation Complete
    
	  Answer "n" to next floppy.
    
    After SLS unx235 is installed, you may install other SCO products, such as 
    SCO TCP/IP Release 1.1.1b.
