Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) NET362B contains new NFS 
drivers that provide support for mounting High-Sierra (CD-ROM) file
systems across NFS. 

SLS NET362B is only applicable to systems running SCO NFS Release 1.2.0,
which includes SCO Open Desktop Release 2.0.  Do not install this SLS
on any other releases of NFS.

During installation you may be prompted for the NFS, or SCO Open Desktop, 
serial number and activation key depending on your current system
configuration.  Please read through the installation notes for further
information.

In order to mount High-Sierra file systems across SCO NFS, install SLS 
NET362B on the NFS Server (the machine to which the CD-ROM device is 
physically connected).  You do NOT need to install this SLS on any of 
the NFS Client machines.


NOTES:
------
(1)    This SLS requires that the High-Sierra file system is already
       configured in the UNIX kernel, otherwise it will fail to 
       relink the kernel during installation with:

                undefined               first referenced
                symbol                    in file

                hsinit                  /etc/conf/pack.d/nfs/Driver.o

        ld fatal: Symbol referencing errors. No output written to UNIX
        ERROR: Can not link-edit unix.

        You can configure the High-Sierra file system in the kernel
        by running:

                mkdev high-sierra    

        You will also need to configure the CD-ROM devices by running:

                mkdev cdrom


(2)     Be sure to mount the High-Sierra file system locally on the server 
        first, BEFORE advertising it over NFS with exportfs (NADM).
        Failure to do so will give the error:

                mount: access denied for <server_name>:/<mount_dir>

        You can correct this by running:

                # exportfs -av

        This will re-export the CD-ROM file system after it has been
        mounted locally first.
        This is not a problem when the file systems are automatically
        mounted when going multiuser, using /etc/default/filesys, as 
        they are mounted before exportfs (NADM) is run.


                        INSTALLATION  INSTRUCTIONS
                        ==========================

To install SLS NET362B, take the following steps:

        1. If you have a previous release of this SLS installed, be 
           sure to remove it first.

        2. Shutdown and reboot your system.  Enter System Maintenance
           mode by typing the root password at the prompt:

                Type <Ctrl>d to proceed with normal startup,
                (or give root password for System Maintenance)

        3. Type:

                /etc/custom

        4. The main custom "menu" will appear.  The "Install" option
           will be highlighted.  Press <Return> to select "Install".

        5. A list of installed products will appear.  The first item in
           the list, "A New Product", is highlighted.  Press <Return> to
           select "A New Product".

        6. Custom will now display your installation options.  By default,
           "Entire Product" is highlighted.  Press <Return> to select
           "Entire Product".

        7. Custom will prompt you to insert "Distribution Floppy Volume 1".  
           Insert the enclosed floppy disk into the drive and press 
           <Return> while "Continue" is highlighted.

        8. After extracting some information from the floppy disk, custom
           will display information indicating that it is saving some
           files.  Custom will next prompt you to insert "SCO NFS 1.2.0
           CD-ROM SLS Floppy volume 1".  Press <Return> while "Continue" 
           is highlighted.

        9. If you are using SCO Open Desktop 2.0 skip this step, SCO Open
	   Desktop 2.0 systems will attempt to serialize automatically from 
	   previous data.  This step is only applicable to SCO NFS 1.2.0 
	   standalone systems.

           After extracting some files you will be asked to enter the serial 
	   number and activation key.  Enter the appropriate serial number 
	   and activation key based on the information detailed on the screen.

        10. The next prompt will be:
        
                "Do you wish to relink the kernel now? (y/n/q)"

            Type "y" at this prompt.

        11. After linking the kernel, custom will prompt you:

                "Do you want this kernel to boot by default? (y/n)"

            Type "y" at the prompt:

        12. Custom will then prompt you:

                "Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)"

            Type "y" at the prompt:

        13. Custom will prompt you to "Press any key to continue".
            Press <Return>.  Custom will then display the message:

                "Checking file permissions..."

        14. After completing these steps, you will be returned to 
            the main custom menu.  You may quit out of custom at
            this time.
 
            To reboot the system, type:

                /etc/reboot

       15. Bring the system up and enter multiuser mode for the
           changes to take effect.
