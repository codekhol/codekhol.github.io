Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) xnx316 contains a new set of 
drivers for the Adaptec 154x/1640 series of host adapters, as well as a 
new version of /usr/lib/mkdev/tape.

It provides the following SCSI support:

     . Adds support for a Wangtek 5525ES and Tecmar Q5525ES SCSI tape 
       drive on an Adaptec 154x/1640 host adapter.

     . Adds support for a SCSI tape drive on an Adaptec 154x/1640 with the
       BIOS disabled (the boot disk is not on the host adapter).

     . Adds the ability to do the tape commands using the device 
       /dev/xct0 for all supported SCSI tape drives.
    
     . Enables multiple volume spanning of all supported SCSI tape
       drives with cpio(C).

SLS xnx316 can be installed only on SCO XENIX Operating System Release 2.3.4 
or Release 2.3.4 GT for computers based on Micro Channel Architecture (MCA).


I. INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

To begin the installation of SLS xnx316, take the following steps:

1.  Please make sure you are installing this SLS on the correct version of 
    the SCO XENIX System, as described previously.  Next, make sure the system
    is in single user mode.  If it is running in multiuser mode, log in as 
    root and execute the command:

             shutdown 0

    The system will then execute a controlled shutdown operation which
    will display the following message when the shutdown process has
    completed:

	**   Safe to Power Off   **
	           -or-
	** Press Any Key to Reboot **

2.  Reboot the system.

3.  When the system reboots, you will see the message:

	Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
	(or give root password for system maintenance):

    Enter the root password and press <Return>.
    Wait until the "#" prompt appears.

4.  Next, go into custom by entering the command:

	custom

    NOTE: Refer to custom(C) in the SCO XENIX manuals for more information
	  on how to use custom.

5.  You will see a menu similar to the following:
        
        	1. Operating System
        	2. Development System
        	3. Text Processing System
        	4. Add a Supported Product
        
    Choose selection 4, "Add a Supported Product".  You will then be
    prompted to insert distribution volume 1.  At this point, insert 
    the diskette labeled Volume 1 and press <Return>. 

    The installation will back up your original files to a special directory.
        
    If the Link kit is not installed, you will be asked to install it. 
    Answer 'y' to the question to install the Link Kit.

6.  It will then give the following menu:

                1. Install one or more packages
                2. Remove one or more packages
                3. List the available packages
                4. List the files in a package
                5. Install a single file

                7. Display current disk usage
                8. Help
        
    Choose 1 to install the packages.  When it asks which packages to 
    install, type "ALL" and press <Return>.
        
    The system will then ask you to insert the Adaptec SCSI Tape SLS for 
    XENIX volume 1 and press <Return>.  Since it is already in the drive,
    press <Return>.

7.  The system will bring in the new drivers and archive them.  It will
    then tell you that you will need to reconfigure your tape drive.
