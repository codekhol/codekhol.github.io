Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx279 is specifically designed
for and resolves outstanding problems with the SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 
3.2 Operating System Version 2.0 GT.  Some of these problems (items 1-3 below) 
are corrected in SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 2.0
for computers based on Micro Channel Architecture (MCA), Open Desktop Release 
1.1, and on systems with SCO MPX Release 1.1 installed.  Therefore, SLS unx279 
is not needed and will not install on these particular releases.  If you have 
one of these releases, and it is based on SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 
Operating System Version 2.0, you may still want to install the new version of 
vi provided with this SLS using the procedure in the section of this letter 
entitled "TO INSTALL ONLY THE VI PORTION OF THE SCO UNIX MAINTENANCE DISK".

The following problems are addressed by SLS unx279:

	(1) Processes using the plock() system call would hang
	    indefinitely.  Ps(C) would show the process state 
	    as "B" when this occurred.

	(2) Under a rare set of conditions, the in-core inode 
	    table would appear to end up with an invalid
	    entry.  In actuality, the problem was with the 
	    directory name cache scheme which was added to 
	    improve performance in the SCO UNIX System V/386 
	    Release 3.2 Operating System Version 2.0 - hence 
	    fsck would not detect an error.

	(3) 14 character directory names could not be renamed.

        (4) Heavy serial input on a line with echo enabled would cause
            the system to hang.  Degradation of i/o on other serial lines 
	    would be observed before the system would finally hang.  The 
	    onset of data loss on serial terminals occurred after a few 
	    minutes.  The effect was seen on the systems own serial ports,
	    as well as those available on add-in multiport cards.  The 
	    problem was caused by all available clist structures getting 
	    filled with buffered (echoed) data.  Increasing the tunable 
	    parameter to increase the number of clists available merely 
	    increased the time before hangup occurred.

        (5) The vi(C), vedit(C), and view(C) utilities did not properly 
	    reset their modes when resumed after being stopped by the 
	    POSIX job control signal SIGTSTP.


To install SLS unx279, shutdown your system with:

    /etc/shutdown

and bring your system up in System Maintenance mode.  Insert the floppy 
into your floppy drive and, at a root prompt, type:

    /etc/xinstall
        
You will see the following message:

    For each volume in the distribution set, insert the
    floppy into the drive, enter 'y', and press <RETURN>.
    Enter the letter 'n' after the last volume.
    
    Should you see the message 'tar: please mount new volume'
    insert the next floppy, and press <RETURN>.

    First Floppy? (y/n)

At this point enter 'y' and press <RETURN>.  You will then see the 
message:

    Extracting files...
    
If you do not have the LINK kit installed, you will be prompted with 
the following message:

    You must have the LINK kit installed
    Do you wish to install the LINK kit now (y/n)

Enter 'y' and then <RETURN>.  You will then be prompted for the 
diskettes, and the serial number and activation key, all of which 
were supplied with your SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating 
System Version 2.0.  Once this process is complete, or if you already 
have the LINK kit installed on your system, you will then see the 
following message:

    Backing up /etc/conf/pack.d/kernel/io.o /etc/conf/pack.d/kernel/io.o.bak
    Backing up /etc/conf/pack.d/kernel/os.o /etc/conf/pack.d/kernel/os.o.bak
    Backing up /etc/conf/pack.d/s5/Driver.o /etc/conf/pack.d/s5/Driver.o.bak
    Backing up /usr/include/sys/nami.h /usr/include/sys/nami.h.bak 
    Backing up /bin/vi /bin/vi.bak
    Backing up /usr/bin/view /usr/bin/view.bak
    Backing up /usr/bin/vedit /usr/bin/vedit.bak
    Backing up /usr/bin/vi /usr/bin/vi.bak

The installation will now prompt you for your serial number and activation 
key.  You will then see the following message:

    	The UNIX Operating System will now be rebuilt.
    	This will take a few minutes.  Please wait.

    	Root for this system build is /

    	The UNIX Kernel has been rebuilt.

    Do you want this kernel to boot by default (y/n)
    
Enter 'y' followed by <RETURN>.  You will see the message:

    Backing up /unix to /unix.old
    Installing new /unix

    The kernel environment includes device node files and /etc/inittab.
    The new kernel may require changes to /etc/inittab or device nodes.

    Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt? (y/n)

Enter 'n' followed by <RETURN> and you will see the message:

    Device node or inittab changes associated with this new kernel have not
    been made.  These changes should be made by running touch /etc/new_unix;
    /etc/conf/bin/mkenv.

    Next Floppy? (y/n)



At this point, enter 'n' followed by <RETURN>.  You must now reboot the 
system so that the changes made by SLS unx279 can take effect.  To shutdown 
your system, first make certain that all users are logged off the system. 
Enter the command:

    shutdown -g0 -y

SLS unx279 will take effect when your system is rebooted.  Note: If you 
re-install your LINK kit, you will need to re-install SLS unx279.



TO INSTALL ONLY THE VI PORTION OF THE SCO UNIX MAINTENANCE DISK
===============================================================

(1) Log in as root and back up your original vi, vedit and view binaries 
    (these are typically linked to the same file) with the following 
    commands:

	cd /usr/bin
	mv vi vi.old
	mv view view.old
	mv vedit vedit.old

(2) Now, extract the vi portion of SLS unx279 with the tar(C) command
    as shown in the example below:

	cd /
	tar xvf /dev/install ./usr/bin/vi

(3)  Finally, link the new vi to the view and vedit binaries using the
     ln(C) command as shown:

	cd /usr/bin
	ln vi view
	ln vi vedit
