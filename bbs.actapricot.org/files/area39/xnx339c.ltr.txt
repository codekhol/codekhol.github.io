Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) xnx339c contains modified kernel
modules that address the six issues listed below.  
        

         (1)  Bus corruption and kernel PANIC if:
              (A)   A driver is configured at spl7 on the second PIC;
              (B)   The same driver is being used under heavy interrupt load;
              (C)   DMA is being used.

         (2)  Drivers that make use of the secondary PIC by using IRQ 30 
	      through 37 octal, or 24 through 31 decimal, may have the 
	      interrupt blocked until the SPL in the kernel is at level 0
              (SCO XENIX 386 Operating System Release 2.3.4 specific).
	      Under heavy load this may result in data loss for non-intelligent
	      serial cards that are attached to the second PIC.
              There are two PICs on a typical PC platform.   The diagram
              below shows the number of the IRQ and where they are assigned.
              Please note that, on your system, not all IRQ's may be used.

                       PIC 1                      PIC  2
                      +-----+
              CPU <---|  0  |-- clock          octal  decimal
                      |  1  |-- keyboard      +--------------+
                      |  2  |<----------------|  30     24   |--
                      |  3  |-- tty2a         |  31     25   |--  tape/net
                      |  4  |-- tty1a         |  32     26   |--
                      |  5  |-- lp2 or tape   |  33     27   |--  serial
                      |  6  |-- floppy        |  34     28   |--  serial
                      |  7  |-- lp0 or lp1    |  35     29   |--  FPU
                      +-----+                 |  36     30   |--  hdisk
                                              |  37     31   |--  hdisk/scsi
                                              +--------------+

         (3)  Under SCO XENIX Release 2.3.4 386 GT, the use of DMA
	      Channel 3 will fail unless the kernel has been modified
	      with adb(CP), as instructed in the SCO XENIX System V
	      Operating System Release Notes dated "12 August 1991."
	      Previous releases of the Release Notes will not have
	      this information.  The adb patch was:

                /etc/_fst -w /xenix
                dma_param+e ?w c033
                dma_enable+d ?w c033
                dma_resid+d ?w c033
                \$q

	      In addition, the Release Notes ensure that the above 
	      adb patch is applied each time you relink the kernel 
	      by adding the following lines to the bottom of the file 
	      /usr/sys/conf/hdinstall:

                /etc/_fst -w /xenix << EOF
                dma_param+e ?w c033
                dma_enable+d ?w c033
                dma_resid+d ?w c033
                \$q
		EOF

              NOTE:  This patch is not needed if SLS xnx339c is installed.
                     SLS xnx339c will test for the presence of this adb
		     patch in /usr/sys/conf/hdinstall.  If the patch is
		     detected, the installation of SLS xnx339c will abort
		     and will not install until you delete the above
		     adb patch from /usr/sys/conf/hdinstall.

         (4)  File system corruption in the form of unreferenced files.

         (5)  Shared memory problems.  For example, as found in SCO uniPATH 
	      SNA-3270 Release 2.1.

         (6)  Kernel/machine hangs during boot or installation due to
	      spurious interrupts.

         NOTE: Item 1 and 2 above would seem to conflict.  The kernel was
               changed in SCO XENIX Release 2.3.4 to behave as in item 2 to 
	       prevent the possibility of a panic listed in item 1.  This 
	       SLS provides a correct solution to both problems.


INSTALLATION:

Before attempting to install this SLS, you must be running one of the following
releases:

         SCO XENIX 386 Operating System Release 2.3.2 with xnx155
         SCO XENIX 386 Operating System Release 2.3.2 with xnx296
         SCO XENIX 386 Operating System Release 2.3.4

	 Note:  Support Level Supplements xnx155 and xnx296 apply to
		SCO XENIX 386 Operating System Release 2.3.2 only.
		Each will upgrade the system from Release 2.3.2 to
		Release 2.3.3.  SLS xnx339c will not install on
		Release 2.3.2 unless SLS xnx155 or SLS xnx296 have
		been installed.

To verify the correct release of the operating system look at the boot screen 
or use the command:

        uname -r 

from the shell prompt.  It should respond with either 2.3.3 or 2.3.4.
The LINK kit must be installed; this can be verified with custom(ADM).

        (1)   From the "#" prompt, type "custom" followed by <Return>.

        (2)   Select option "1" from the custom(ADM) menu to select
              "Operating System".

        (3)   Select option "3" from the custom menu to "List the available
              packages".

        (4)   The "LINK" package must have a "yes" beside it.

Next you need to be in single-user mode.  Please follow the instructions
below to install SLS xnx339c.


        (1)   From the "#" prompt, type "custom" followed by <Return>.

        (2)   Select option 4 from the custom(ADM) menu to  "Add a
              Supported Product".

        (3)   Insert the floppy when prompted and press <Return>.

        (4)   Answer "y" followed by <Return> to continue the installation.
         
        (5)   Select option "1" from the custom menu to "Install one or
              more packages".

        (6)   Enter "all" followed by <Return>.

        (7)   Press <Return> again since the floppy is already in the drive.
        
        (8)   Answer "y" to the prompt "Do you want this kernel to boot by
              default (y/n)?" and press <Return>.

        (9)   Select "q" to quit from the custom(ADM) menu.

        (10)  Now remove the floppy from the drive.

        (11)  Reboot the system with the reboot command:
              "reboot <Return>"
