Dear Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) unx220 contains the 
software to support the Hayes V-Series 9600 Modem. This modem
can now be used with SCO XENIX System V and SCO UNIX System V/386
Operating Systems.

To install SLS unx220, take the following steps:

(1) Make sure that your operating system installation includes
    the UUCP utilities.
 
(2) Make sure that you are in single user (Maintenance) mode.

(3) Log in as root.

(4) Use 'custom' to install this SLS unx220. Make the 'custom' selections 
    to install a supported or new product and then the selections to 
    install an individual package of that product.

(6) Then install one of the following choices as appropriate:
	
	Hayes V-Series Modem Support Module (SCO UNIX 386)
	Hayes V-Series Modem Support Module (SCO XENIX 386)
	Hayes V-Series Modem Support Module (SCO XENIX 286)

(7) The installation is now complete.

(8) Please note that after the installation is complete, the packages 
    may show "Part" or "Yes" even though they are not installed. This 
    is because the packages have files in common. 

Yours sincerely,


Technical Support Department
