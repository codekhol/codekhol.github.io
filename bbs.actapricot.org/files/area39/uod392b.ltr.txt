Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) UOD392B (System Security 
Enhancements) corrects flaws found in these programs:

        at(C)
        login(M)
        mail(C) / mailx(C)
        prwarn(C)
        sadc(ADM)
        /usr/lib/pt_chmod
        /usr/mmdf/chans/local
        ex(C) / edit(C)                 *** New to UOD392B ***
        vi(C) / view(C) / vedit(C)      *** New to UOD392B ***

Previously, these programs could have allowed a user with an existing 
login account to obtain unauthorized privileged access to the system.

In passwd(C), a flaw which could corrupt the password databases, 
preventing all logins, has been corrected.

IMPORTANT: SLS UOD368B (the replacement passwd(C) supplement) 
           must be removed before installing SLS UOD392B.

SLS UOD392B applies to these releases:

        SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.2
        SCO Open Desktop Lite Release 3.0
        SCO Open Desktop Release 3.0
        SCO Open Server Enterprise System Release 3.0
        SCO Open Server Network System Release 3.0


Using custom(ADM) to install SLS UOD392B
________________________________________

1.  If the system is running in multiuser mode, log in as root on the 
    console.  After warning the users that the system will be down for 
    some time, enter the command:

        shutdown  -y -g0 su

2.  When the system enters single-user mode, you will see the message:

        Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
        (or give root password for System Maintenance):

    Enter the root password and press <Enter>.
    Wait until the "#" prompt appears.

3.  Insert the custom volume disk labeled "UOD392B SLS Custom 
    Install Disk" in the floppy drive and enter the command:

        /etc/custom

    The custom menu will appear.

4.  To select the following, highlight each one with the cursor keys 
    and press <Enter>:

        Install -> A New Product -> Entire Product

    Position the cursor so that "Install" is highlighted and 
    press <Enter>.

    Make sure the words "A New Product" are highlighted in the window
    found in the lower right corner of the screen; press <Enter>.

    Make sure the words "Entire Product" are highlighted in the "Choose 
    an option" section of the screen; press <Enter>.

    You will be prompted to "Insert distribution Volume 1 and 
    press <Enter>".  Make sure the disk is already in the 
    drive and press <Enter>.  You will see:

       Installing custom data files
       Executing Product Prep Script
   
    The message "Saving files about to be Replaced" will flash on the 
    screen.  You will be prompted to "Insert the requested Volume and 
    press <Enter>".  The disk is already in the drive, therefore 
    press <Enter>.  You will see:

       Extracting Files

    You will then be prompted to "Press any key to continue"; 
    press <Enter>.

    At the main custom menu, move the highlighted entry to "Quit" and 
    press <Enter>.  Press <Enter> again on the highlighted "yes."
     
    Reboot the computer.

    SLS UOD392B is now successfully installed.
