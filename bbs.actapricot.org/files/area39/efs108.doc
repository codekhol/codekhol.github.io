                          SCO Xsight 2.3 Server EFS



                               ADDITIONAL NOTES


                       For The SCO Xsight 2.3 Server EFS





	1.  Introduction

	This document contains important information regarding the SCO Xsight 
        2.3 Server EFS (Extended Functionality Supplement) product.  This 
        information supplements the contents of the ``SCO Xsight 2.3 Server EFS 
        Release and Installation Notes'' and should be read in conjunction with
	these notes, before you begin installation of this product.


	2.  Addendum to the Xsight 2.3 Server Limitations Section

	This section supplements the information described in the ``Xsight 2.3 
        Server Limitations'' section, beginning on page 2-5 in the ``SCO Xsight 
        2.3 Server EFS Release and Installation Notes.''  The following list 
        describes additional limitations to the Xsight 2.3 server of which you
        should be aware:

	  o If you are using an ATI WONDER +(R) graphics adapter on a system 
            running Open Desktop(R) 1.0, do not run your server in high 
            resolution mode (800x600).  Using this card in high resolution 
            mode causes your screen to either display black streaks or turns 
            your screen completely black when you execute the server.  If you
	    experience this problem, press <Alt><SysReq> to end your current 
            session and then reconfigure your adapter to use 640x480 resolution.
            Note that this problem does not apply if you are running Open 
            Desktop 1.1.

	  o If you are using the XENIX(R) operating system, version 2.3.2 with 
            UFJ, you cannot successfully run COFF binaries on your machine.  If
            you need to use COFF binaries, obtain and install UFM on your 
            system.

	  o The ``Xsight 2.3 Server Limitations'' section in the release notes 
            indicates that the COMPAQ(R) VGC grafinfo entry causes the server 
            to fail on a system running MPX 1.1.  This is not completely 
            accurate in that the limitation is not related or restricted to 
            the presence of MPX 1.1.  The COMPAQ VGC grafinfo entry simply
	    causes the server to fail.  To avoid this limitation, use the 
            IBM(R) VGA grafinfo entry instead.




        The Santa Cruz Operation            1            Xsight 2.3 Server EFS

	  o If you run startx when TCP/IP is not installed on your system, 
            you see the following warning:

                 libsocket: open (/dev/socksys) failure: no such file or
                 directory

	    Your X session then executes without any further problems.

	  o When you install the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS on a machine running 
            any of the supported operating system environments (Open Desktop 
            1.0, Open Desktop 1.1, SCO UNIX(R) System V 3.2.2, or XENIX 2.3.2 
            or later), the installation process removes a few grafinfo files 
            that are now obsolete and renames a few other grafinfo files.  
            However, these grafinfo files remain listed in their original form 
            in the operating system runtime perms file.  These two factors 
            result in the appearance of a partially installed runtime system, 
            when in fact, your operating system is completely installed.  
            Because of this inconsistency, it is possible that you may
	    experience problems with future installations.

	    If, in the future, you experience a failed installation due to the 
            appearance of a partially installed operating system, you need to 
            log in to your system as the Super User (root) and edit the 
            /etc/perms/rts file.  Locate and delete the following lines from 
            the file:

                 /usr/lib/grafinfo/olivetti
                 /usr/lib/grafinfo/olivetti/evc-1.xgi

	    Note that if you are running Open Desktop 1.1 with Update F, you 
            also need to edit /etc/perms/rts.UF (also as the Super User) and 
            delete every occurrence of the following lines from the file:

                 /usr/lib/grafinfo/olivetti
                 /usr/lib/grafinfo/hp
                 /usr/lib/grafinfo/olivetti/evc-1.xgi
                 /usr/lib/grafinfo/hp/igc.xgi

	    Making these modifications to /etc/perms/rts and, if necessary, to 
            /etc/perms/rts.UF, resolves any perms list inconsistencies on your 
            system.  You can now run installations that rely on a fully 
            installed operating system.


	3.  Addendum to the TI34010 Graphics Adapter Limitations Section

	This section supplements the information on card-specific limitations, 
        described in the ``TI34010 Graphics Adapters'' section, beginning on 
        page 2-7 in the ``SCO Xsight 2.3 Server EFS Release and Installation 
        Notes.''  The following item describes an additional TI34010 limitation:

	  o You cannot run the 2.3 server on a COMPAQ AG1024 graphics adapter 
            that is installed on a COMPAQ SystemPro machine.  If you are using 
            this hardware configuration and you attempt to run the server, your
	    screen display is severely distorted, to the point of being 
            unusable.


        The Santa Cruz Operation            2            Xsight 2.3 Server EFS

	4.  Addendum to the 8514/A Graphics Adapter Limitations Section

	This section supplements the information on card-specific limitations, 
        described in the ``8514/A Graphic Adapters'' section, beginning on page
        2-13 in the ``SCO Xsight 2.3 Server EFS Release and Installation 
        Notes.''  The following list describes additional limitations when 
        using an 8514/A graphics adapter with the 2.3 server:

	  o If you are using an 8514/A graphics adapter and you are running 
            multiple ODT-DOS windows in which you need to zoom applications, 
            there is a limitation regarding the method in which you end your 
            ODT-DOS sessions.  If you zoom an application in an ODT-DOS window 
            and then close that window by pressing <Alt>4 or by double-clicking
            on the Window menu button, the server will crash the next time you 
            zoom an application in one of your other ODT-DOS windows.

	    To avoid this problem, do not use <Alt>4 or the Window menu button 
            to close an ODT-DOS window in which you have zoomed an application.
            Instead, exit your application as you would normally.  Then, at the
            DOS prompt in the window, type quit and press <Return> to end the 
            ODT-DOS session.

	  o If you are using an 8514/A or 8514-compatible graphics adapter on 
            a system running Open Desktop 1.1, you may notice that, on some 
            displays, the background of Directory windows shimmers such that 
            the screen is difficult to view.  If you experience this problem, 
            you need to edit the /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xhibit file and
	    search for the following lines:

                 ! Set texture of directory windows
                 Xhibit*directory*container*back*backgroundPixmap :
                          /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/xdt_textures/dir_w_bg.px

	    When you locate these lines, replace the default resource 
	    specification, /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/xdt_textures/dir_w_bg.px,
	    with the entry displayed below:

                 /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/xdt_textures/blank.px

    1.1  Introduction

    This chapter describes how to install and configure the Xsight 2.3
    Server EFS.

    To facilitate the installation process, this chapter includes a check-
    list that you can use to record crucial pieces of information ahead of
    time.  This way you already have the answers to major prompts when you
    run the installation.

    The Xsight 2.3 Server EFS installation uses a utility called
    custom(ADM).  When custom installs a software product, the files that
    comprise the product are transferred from the media on which the
    software product is distributed and stored on disk.  Using the infor-
    mation supplied in a parameter list, custom places the files in the
    correct locations, assigns permissions, and performs optional tasks
    such as making device nodes.

    The custom utility also gives you the flexibility to install packages
    (sets of files grouped logically) instead of the entire Xsight 2.3
    Server EFS product.  This EFS includes three packages, two of which
    (XRT and GRF) you definitely want to install.  You should only install
    the third package, (INL), if you have the development system and are
    planning to create internationalized X applications.  If you have only
    the runtime system, installing the INL package would only be a waste
    of your disk space.

    Keep the two floppy diskettes containing the EFS packages until the
    next release of Open Desktop or your operating system.  You may be
    called upon to install or reinstall the packages if you upgrade the
    software or hardware on your system.

    Please read these notes completely before you begin installing the
    Xsight 2.3 Server EFS.  The information contained within these
    chapters is crucial to the proper installation and operation of the
    new server.



































    1-2              SCO Xsight 2.3 Server EFS Release and Installation Notes



    1.2  Installation Overview

    You can install the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS on any one of the following
    environments:

       o XENIX 2.3.2 or later with Xsight 2.2

       o SCO Open Desktop 1.0

       o SCO Open Desktop 1.1

       o SCO UNIX System V 3.2.2 with Xsight 2.2

    Before installing the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS, you should observe the
    precautions and information described in the following sections.


    1.2.0.1  Prerequisites for Installation

       o Please read all chapters in this document before installing the
         Xsight 2.3 Server EFS.

       o Fill out the installation checklist found in the next section of
         this chapter.  Information on how to fill out the checklist is
         also included in the next section.

       o After you fill out the checklist, log in as root and bring the
         system to single-user mode.

       o Be certain that you are in the root (/) directory before you
         start the installation procedure.

       o Do not remove any previously installed versions of ODT-VIEW or
         Xsight before installing the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS as this pro-
         duct does not replace all of the files that are removed.





















    Installing Your Software                                              1-3



    1.2.0.2  Serialization for the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS

    This EFS does not come with its own serialization card (information
    sheet).  To serialize this product, you must enter the serial number
    and activation key that were provided with your Open Desktop product
    or your Xsight 2.2 product.  You are prompted for this information
    during the installation process.


    1.2.0.3  Installing the International Keyboard Supplement

    The International Keyboard Development Supplement (INL) package pro-
    vides files for developers who want to extend the keyboard support for
    their X applications.  You do not need to install the INL package
    unless you intend to perform this kind of development.

    Note that this package is only useful if you have the development sys-
    tem for your specific operating system and either the Open Desktop
    development system or the Xsight 2.2 development system.


    1.2.0.4  Video Graphics Support under XENIX

    If you are using a XENIX system, the new video graphics card support
    provided by the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS is not apparent when you install
    the product.  The list of supported graphics adapters displayed during
    the video configuration portion of the installation is incomplete.  If
    your particular graphics adapter is not listed, but it is included in
    Table A.1, ``Graphics Adapter Card Designations,'' in Appendix A in
    these notes, you have to add the definition line for your adapter to
    the /usr/lib/grafinfo/grafinfo.def file.  Refer to the section ``Ins-
    talling on XENIX'' for information on how to do this.


    1.2.0.5  Replacing Modified .Xsight.cfg Files

    The Xsight 2.3 Server EFS product includes a new version of the
    /usr/lib/X11/.Xsight.cfg file.  This new version of the file is
    required for successful use of the new Xsight server supplied in this
    release.  Be sure to inform all users on your system who may have
    created a custom version of .Xsight.cfg in their home directories to
    remove their copy of the file, replace it with the new version, and
    reincorporate their modifications before invoking the server.  Failure
    to do this can cause the server to fail when started.

    1.3  Installation Checklist

    Before you begin the installation of the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS, use
    the checklist that follows to write down the information you need to
    respond to prompts during the installation procedure.

    The sections following the actual checklist describe the categories on
    the checklist and explain how to fill out each of the items.  Some
    sections may refer you to another chapter in these ``Release and Instal-
    lation Notes,'' where the information for an item is contained.

    Record all of the necessary information for the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS
    installation on this checklist now, before you begin the actual ins-
    tallation process. Using the checklist saves you the time and confu-
    sion of trying to answer the prompts as you go.  As a result, the ins-
    tallation proceeds much more quickly and smoothly.

    The following sections describe each of the categories on the check-
    list and explain how to fill out the checklist items.


        1. Operating System

           The type of operating system your computer runs determines
           which installation procedure you use to install the Xsight 2.3
           Server EFS.

           If you are running the UNIX operating system or Open Desktop,
           use the installation procedure described in the section ``Ins-
           talling on the UNIX System or Open Desktop.''  If you are run-
           ning the XENIX system, use the installation procedure
           described in the section ``Installing on XENIX.''

        2. Packages to Install

           You need to decide which portions of the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS
           product you want to install.  The Xsight 2.3 Server EFS con-
           sists of three distinct packages of files:

               o XRT - SCO Xsight Server Runtime files

               o GRF - Grafinfo files

               o INL - International Keyboard Development Supplement files

           In all cases, you should install the XRT and GRF packages.
           If you intend to write your own international X clients,
           install the INL package.  This package also permits you to
           extend the functionality of international keyboard keymaps.

           Note that you must have the Open Desktop or Xsight 2.2
           development system, as well as the development system for your
           operating system installed on your computer to use the INL
           package for development purposes.

           You only need to install the entire product if you have use
           for all of the packages included on the EFS distribution.

        3. Serialization

           You cannot completely install the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS
           without entering the correct serial number and activation key.
           However, the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS product does not come with
           its own specific serial number and activation key.  Instead,
           you must enter the codes that were provided on the Serializa-
           tion Card (information sheet) included with either your Open
           Desktop product or, if you are running the UNIX operating sys-
           tem or XENIX system, with your Xsight 2.2 product.

        4. Video Adapter

           As part of the installation procedure, you must configure your
           video graphics adapter and its mode, or resolution, for your
           system.  See Appendix A, ``Video Configuration,'' for a list
           of supported graphics adapters and modes to verify that your
           adapter and the resolution you desire is available.  Refer to
           your video adapter documentation for specific information on
           your card's capabilities.

           If you are using Open Desktop, version 1.1 or later, you can
           also assign the adapter you are configuring to terminal dev-
           ices on your system.  You can select either Default, in which
           case all devices on your system are associated with the
           current adapter, or you can select Specify, in which case you
           list the specific terminal devices that you want associated
           with the adapter.  Generally, you should select Default; how-
           ever, there are special circumstances under which you might
           choose Specify.  For example, if your system has both mono-
           chrome and VGA graphics adapters, you can assign several ter-
           minal devices to the monochrome adapter and several other ter-
           minal devices to the VGA adapter.  If you want to assign
           specific terminals, list the desired devices on the checklist.

        5. Manual Video Adapter Configuration under XENIX

           If you are using the XENIX system, your adapter type may not
           be displayed during the video configuration portion of the
           installation, and you may have to configure your adapter your-
           self.















    1-8              SCO Xsight 2.3 Server EFS Release and Installation Notes



            After you complete the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS installation, you
            need to include the appropriate adapter type and mode entry in
            the grafinfo.def file, located in the /usr/lib/grafinfo direc-
            tory.  The grafinfo.def entries follow a specific format.
            Refer to Table A.1, ``Graphics Adapter Card Designations,'' in
            Appendix A, ``Video Configuration,'' for your graphics
            adapter, its supported modes of operation, and the related
            grafinfo.def entry.

    ************************************************************************

    NOTE

        If your adapter type and the desired mode is not listed in Table A.1
        in Appendix A, it is not supported by the SCO Xsight Server.

    *************************************************************************

            As an example, the grafinfo.def entry for an ATI Wonder graph-
            ics adapter and a monitor that supports 640x480 resolution
            would be:

                 ati.wonder.vga.640x480-16

            The grafinfo.def entry should be lowercase and the file can
            only contain one entry.

         During this installation, several important configuration files are
         overwritten with new versions of the files.  Because you may have made
         important modifications to these files that you do not want to lose,
         custom creates backup copies of the files before they are overwritten.
         The backup files are located in the same directories as the original
         files, and the backup filenames consist of the original filename and a
         .00 suffix.  After the installation process is complete, you can re-
         customize the new configuration files, using the backup copies as a 
         reference for the modifications you previously made.

         If you started custom from sysadmsh, exit sysadmsh now too.

    26.  Remove the distribution media from the disk drive.

    27.  If you changed from a monochrome-based adapter to a color adapter
         or vice versa, or if you added a high resolution monitor to your

         not make any of these changes, proceed to step 29.


    *********************************************************************

    NOTE

        When you run xconfigure, any changes that you previously made in
        the /app-defaults resource files are overwritten.  If you want to
        save these changes, you must copy them to another file before 
        running the configuration script, then manually reapply them to 
        those resource files after running the script.

    28.  Select the appropriate display mode, either color or monochrome.
         If you simply press <Return> at the prompt, color is chosen by
         default.  You return to your operating system prompt.

         When you next run the Desktop, either from Xsight 2.2 or Open
         Desktop, your icons and window manager are automatically adjusted
         for use with your graphics adapter and monitor.

    29.  You can now reboot your system.  Type init 6 at the operating
         system prompt and press <Return>.  The system displays several
         messages, then prompts you to press any key to reboot.  Do so,
         and you return to multiuser mode.

    Installation of the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS product is now complete.
    After you finish using the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS distribution media,
    you should store it in a safe place.  If an accident or a hardware
    failure damages the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS files on your hard disk, you
    need the distribution media to reinstall the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS
    product.

    1.5  Installing on XENIX

    The following procedure explains how to install the Xsight 2.3 Server
    EFS on a computer running the XENIX operating system.  Fill out the
    installation checklist on page 1-6 before you begin this procedure.


     1.  Log in as root.

     2.  Bring the system to single-user mode after informing your users
         to log off.  To enter single-user mode, type:

              /etc/shutdown 0

         Now press <Return>.  Several system messages appear.

     3.  Press any key to reboot the system when the reboot message
         appears.

     4.  Enter the root password at the password prompt.  You are now in
         single-user mode.

     5.  Enter custom directly from the command line by typing custom and
         pressing <Return>, or from sysadmsh by making the following
         sysadmsh selection:

              System-->Add-->Software

         You see a display similar to the following:

    -------------------------- end screen display ----------------------------


     7.  Insert the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS volume 1 into the disk drive and
         press <Return>.  Then the following message appears:


    -------------------------- begin screen display --------------------------

    -------------------------- end screen display ----------------------------


         During this installation, several important configuration files
         are overwritten with new versions of the files.  Because you may
         have made important modifications to these files that you do not
         want to lose, custom creates backup copies of the files before
         they are overwritten.  The backup files are located in the same
         directories as the original files, and the backup filenames con-
         sist of the original filename and a .00 suffix.  After the ins-
         tallation process is complete, you can recustomize the new confi-
         guration files, using the backup copies as a reference for the
         modifications you previously made.

         The following files are backed up:

            o /usr/bin/startx

            o /usr/lib/X11/xsconfig/kb101.kbd

            o /usr/lib/X11/keymaps/kmap.language, where language is a
              two-letter abbreviation of a particular language

    14.  If your graphics adapter is listed on this screen, enter the
         corresponding number and press <Return>.  After making this
         selection, you see a list of graphics adapter modes.  Select the
         desired mode of operation and press <Return>.

         If your graphics adapter is not listed here, you must edit the
         video configuration file manually for your adapter after you com-
         plete this installation.  Type q to quit and press <Return>.

    15.  Press any key to return to the custom main menu.  The installa-
         tion is now complete.  To exit custom, type q.  If you started
         custom from sysadmsh, exit sysadmsh now too.  Remember to remove
         the distribution media from the drive.

    16.  If you were able to configure your graphics adapter during the
         installation, you are now finished.  Type <Ctrl>d to return the
         system to multiuser mode.  You can disregard the remainder of
         this procedure.

    17.  If, however, your graphics adapter was not listed during the ins-
         tallation, you must now manually edit the grafinfo.def video con-
         figuration file.  This file is located in the /usr/lib/grafinfo
         directory; change to this directory now.  Refer to Appendix A,
         ``Video Configuration,'' for more information on the grafinfo.def
         file.

    18.  Use an ASCII editor, such as vi(C), to edit the grafinfo.def
         file.

         If you filled in the installation checklist earlier, refer to
         item 6 on the checklist for the correct grafinfo.def entry for
         your graphics adapter.  Otherwise, see Table A.1, ``Graphics
         Adapter Card Designations,'' in Appendix A, ``Video Configura-
         tion,'' for the list of grafinfo.def entries.

         Note that this file can contain only one line.  Replace any
         existing entry in the file with the entry listed in Appendix A
         for your adapter, using the appropriate syntax. Write and exit
         the file when you are finished.

    19.  Type <Ctrl>d to return the system to multiuser mode.


    Installation of the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS product is now complete.
    After you finish using the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS distribution media,
    you should store it in a safe place.  If an accident or a hardware
    failure damages the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS files on your hard disk, you
    need the distribution media to reinstall the Xsight 2.3 Server EFS
    product.

    2.2.1  Improvements Since Xsight 2.2

    The changes that occurred between the last version of the server,
    Xsight 2.2, and the current version of the server, Xsight 2.3,
    include:

       o Extended graphics adapter support is now available.  Specifi-
         cally, the new server adds support for the following VGA
         adapters, in 800x600 16-color mode:

            - ATI VGA WONDER

            - ATI WONDER PLUS

            - Chips 451

            - Chips 452

            - Trident TVGA 8900

            - Verticom MX/AT

         Additionally, the new server also supports the Chips 452 and Tri-
         dent TVGA 8900 adapters in 1024x768 mode.

         The new server also supports 8514/A and TI34010-based graphics
         adapters in 256-color mode and Cornerstone adapters in modes up
         to 1600x1280 resolution.

       o Graphics operations that did not conform to the X Window system
         protocol in Xsight 2.2, but do conform in Xsight 2.3 are:

              ArcChord        FillStippled   LineOnOffDash
              CapButt         JoinBevel      LineDoubleDash
              CapProjecting   JoinMiter      Plane mask
              CapRound        JoinRound      WindingRule

         Also, width-one wide lines, circles, and ellipses are now
         correctly implemented; and wide LineOnOffDash dashed lines, cir-
         cles, and ellipses now have cap style applied to dash ends.

       o The server defaults to analog mode for VGA servers, providing a
         greater color palette selection.

    2.2.2  Xsight 2.3 Server Fixes

    The following problems with the Xsight server have been fixed:

       o Fonts can now be specified without regard to upper- or lowercase
         naming conventions.  In prior servers, font specifications had to
         match exactly the name of the font file.

       o Transparent stipples for a graphics context now work.

       o Exposure regions are now being computed properly on subwindows
         when an ancestor window is both resized and moved.

       o All known memory leaks in the server have been fixed.  The server
         process size no longer grows when running the same applications
         repeatedly.

       o Problems with the XSetTSOrigin X library function are fixed.

       o The problem with the server sometimes becoming confused about the
         state of the <Alt> or <Ctrl> keys and not recognizing keystroke
         input after you switched screens has been fixed. Note, however,
         that you may still see this problem if you simultaneously press
         both right and left <Alt> or <Ctrl> keys while switching between
         screens.

       o You no longer need to release the <Alt> key to switch back and
         forth between Xserver session and other multiscreens.

       o The XSetPlaneMask X function now works correctly.

       o The incorrect display of dashed lines is now fixed.

       o You can now change the key sequences for switching multiscreens.

       o The X font path includes all three font directories in
         /usr/lib/X11/fonts including, misc, 75dpi, and 100dpi.

    2.2.3  Xsight 2.3 Server Limitations

    The following limitations apply to the Xsight 2.3 server:

       o The server does not support VGA monochrome systems.  If you want
         a monochrome system, we recommend one of the following monochrome
         graphics adapters:  COMPAQ(R) Plasma, Cornerstone, GRiD(R) System
         1530 Display, Hercules(R), Toshiba(R) Grid 758 Plasma, or Toshiba
         Grid Plasma Display.

       o AT mode for a keyboard is not supported in Xsight.

       o The xset command does not support the key click and bell volume
         options.

       o The 2.3 X server will not work with older versions of grafinfo
         files, unless the DEVTECH field for VGA adapters is modified.

       o If you are using the XENIX operating system, version 2.3.2 with
         UFJ, you cannot run your server in high resolution mode (1024x768
         and 800x600), regardless of the graphics adapter installed on
         your system.  If you experience this problem, configure your
         server to use 640x480 mode instead.

         Note that even though you cannot currently use the new server in
         high resolution mode, this EFS is still valuable to your system
         because of the number of previous server limitations that have
         been fixed.  For more information, see the ``Server Improve-
         ments'' section, previously in this chapter.

       o The COMPAQ VGC grafinfo entry causes the server to fail on a sys-
         tem that is running MPX 1.1.  If you experience this problem, use
         the IBM VGA grafinfo entry instead.

       o The ODT-DOS colormap is unusable if you are using Open Desktop
         1.0 and a graphics adapter in 256-color mode.  If you use this
         colormap in 256-color mode, the cursor color and menu foreground
         and background colors are the same as the window background
         color, making the cursor and menus invisible.

       o If you are using Open Desktop 1.0 and you accidentally press
         <Ctrl><Left Mouse Button>, which is an invalid key sequence,
         while in an ODT-DOS window, an I-beam sprite covers the entire
         Workspace window.  To restore mouse input to other open X windows
         and mwm, you must exit the ODT-DOS window.

       o Unzooming an ODT-DOS window can kill your DOS process and close
         the window.  This failure is much more likely if you are running
         multiple X servers and you switch between multiscreens immedi-
         ately after unzooming an ODT-DOS window.

       o You are currently unable to zoom an ODT-DOS program that you
         launch from the Desktop file manager.

    2.3  Vendor-Specific Graphics Adapter Information

    This section lists all vendor-specific information about groups of
    graphics adapters.  The groups are:

       o Texas Instruments 34010-type Adapters

       o Cornerstone Adapters

       o 8514A-type Adapters


    2.3.1  TI34010 Graphics Adapters

    This section contains information about TI34010 cards for this EFS
    release.

    For Xsight 2.3, the following TI34010 cards are supported:  Renais-
    sance Rendition(R) II, COMPAQ AG1024, HP(R) IGC 10.

    Both the 1024x768 16-color mode and the 1024x768 256-color mode are
    supported.  The 256-color mode requires at least 768K VRAM on the Ren-
    dition II card and HP IGC 10 card.

    2.3.1.1  Limitations

    The following limitations apply to all of the TI34010 cards:

       o Zero width arc accuracy is limited to the nearest degree.

       o Only one Xsight server can be run in TI34010 mode at a time.

       o The odd dashes in double-dashed stippled lines are now drawn in
         the foreground color instead of the background color.

       o The Zoom feature in ODT-DOS is currently unavailable.  If you
         access the Dos menu, the Zoom option is grayed out so that you
         cannot select it.


    **********************************************************************
    NOTE

        When you run startx on a system using any of the TI34010 graphics
        adapters, a message quickly flashes on your screen and then disap-
        pears.  This is simply a MetaWINDOWS message; there is nothing 
        wrong with your system.

    **********************************************************************


    The following limitation applies to HP IGC 10 cards only:

       o You cannot use an HP IGC 10 card that is jumpered for 256-color
         mode in 16-color mode.  If you configure such a card for 16-color
         mode in mkdev graphics, you see the following message when you
         run startx:

         You requested 16 color mode.  However, the card is jumpered for
         256 colors.  Do you want to run in 256 color mode (y/n)?

         If you answer y at the prompt, you are switched to 256-color mode
         and the server executes.  If, however, you answer n at the
         prompt, the server automatically exits.

    2.3.1.2  Memory Requirements

    The following are the minimum memory requirements for the cards:

       o Renaissance Rendition-II card requires at least 384K DRAM.

       o COMPAQ AG1024 requires a 512K memory expansion board.

       o HP IGC 10 requires at least 512K DRAM.

    For more information on the memory requirements for your specific
    card, refer to your graphics adapter manual.


    2.3.1.3  VGA Hardware Support

       o The Rendition II card has a VGA daughterboard that can be
         added.

       o The COMPAQ AG1024 can be connected to any VGA card that has
         a feature connector available. Under XENIX, if this option
         is used, Xsight cannot be started in any of the VGA display
         modes.

       o The HP IGC 10 can be connected to the output of any VGA
         card.

    All cards can be run in a dual-display mode (for example, one
    TI34010 card and monitor and a VGA card with an additional moni-
    tor).  All cards have a single display alternative.


    2.3.1.4  CRT Registers

    CRT parameters are in /usr/lib/grafinfo/metload.dat.  The follow-
    ing registers can be modified: HESYNC, HEBLNK, HSBLNK, HTOTAL,
    VESYNC, VEBLNK, VSBLNK, VTOTAL, DPYCTL, DPYSTRT.  Complete
    descriptions of these registers can be found in the TMS34010
    User's Guide.  Descriptions of these registers refer to the VCLK
    value.  For the Rendition II and AG1024 cards, VCLK is the value
    of the pixel clock divided by 16.  For the HP IGC 10, VCLK is the
    value of the pixel clock divided by 8.














    Release Information                                                   2-9



    The pixel clock is a value indicating the current pixel position
    being displayed by the CRT controller as the CRT beam scans
    across the display.  The CRT controller is on the graphics
    adapter.  The pixel clock is defined by the hardware and is
    determined by the resolution of the display.   The value in VCLK
    is specified in the hardware reference manual.  Once you deter-
    mine the value of VCLK, you can calculate the values for the
    HESYNC, HEBLNK, HSBLNK, and HTOTAL, which are all multiples of
    VCLK.  This information is used to adjust the horizontal position
    of the screen for a particular monitor.

    In general, the default values in metload.dat seem to work well
    on multiple frequency monitors such as the Nanao Flexscan and
    MultiSync 4D.  However, there may be some fixed frequency moni-
    tors that require some adjustment of these parameters.

    If you are using the COMPAQ AG1024 card with a multisync monitor,
    you may notice that your screen display is fuzzy.  This is
    because the AG1024 section in metload.dat contains a CONFIG
    register whose default value (0x0018) is optimal for use on a
    COMPAQ monitor.  To correct the fuzziness on your multisync moni-
    tor, replace the default CONFIG value with 0x0040.


    2.3.1.5  I/O Addresses

    The AG1024 and IGC 10 cards have configurable I/O addresses.  The
    values in metload.dat are set up for the default addresses for
    those cards.  If I/O addresses are configured to other than the
    defaults, then the values in metload.dat have to be adjusted.


























    2-10             SCO Xsight 2.3 Server EFS Release and Installation Notes



    The AG1024 can be configured to use I/O addresses beginning at
    0x290 or 0x280.  The factory default is 0x290.  The metload.dat
    is set up to use the factory default.  If the I/O address on the
    card is changed, then the following values in metload.dat under
    the ``AGS'' heading has to be modified:


                      HSTADRL                0x290
                      HSTADRH                0x292
                      HSTDATA                0x294
                      HSTCTL                 0x296
                      CPUCTL                 0x298


    A ``0x28'' value has to replace the ``0x29.'' The last digit
    remains the same.

    The IGC 10 card can be configured to use any one of three dif-
    ferent I/O address ranges that begin at 0x250, 0x290, or 0x350.
    The factory default is 0x250.  If the I/O address on the card is
    changed, then the following values under the ``IGC'' heading have
    to be modified:


                      HSTADRL                0x250
                      HSTADRH                0x252
                      HSTDATA                0x254
                      HSTCTL                 0x256
                      HSTAT                  0x258
                      HRSID                  0x25A


    The value ``0x29'' or ``0x35'' has to be substituted for
    ``0x25.''  The last digit remains unchanged.

    2.3.2  Cornerstone Adapters

    The Xsight 2.3 server supports the following Cornerstone graphics
    adapters for the PC:

       o Cornerstone SinglePage, 768x1008

       o Cornerstone PC1280, 1280x960

       o Cornerstone DualPage, 1600x1280


    2.3.2.1  Limitations

    The following limitations apply to the Cornerstone adapters:

       o The Cornerstone 1280x1024 and 2048x1664 PC adapters are not
         supported and none of the Cornerstone PS/2 adapters are sup-
         ported.

       o A jumper allows the card to run in a different I/O space and
         memory address.  The Cornerstone can then coexist with
         another MDA or Hercules card.  However, Xsight does not
         currently support this mode.

       o In addition to the monochrome modes and graphics modes, the
         Cornerstone adapters support additional memory, permitting
         four or 16 shades of gray.  The server does not currently
         support any of these gray-scale modes.

       o If you are using your Cornerstone adapter in Text mode,
         screen scrolling does not work properly.


    2.3.2.2  Modes

    The Cornerstone adapters are run in one of these modes:

       o text mode

       o Hercules graphics mode

       o high-resolution graphics mode

    Both text mode and the two graphics modes are supported.

    2.3.3  8514/A Graphic Adapters

    The 8514A is a high performance graphics adapter, which can
    display 640x480 or 1024x768 pixels in 16- or 256-colors from a
    palette of 262,144 colors.  You need to install extra memory if
    you want to use the 256-color modes.  The 8514A has hardware sup-
    port for fast line drawing and for rapid drawing or copying of
    rectangular screen areas.  While drawing to the screen, pixels
    can be combined in a large number of ways, including all 16 of
    the standard binary raster operations, such as ANDing, exclusive
    OR, and so on.


    2.3.3.1  Modes

    The 8514A is strictly a graphics device and must be connected to
    the video expansion port on a VGA for text mode operations.  The
    8514A can operate in VGA pass-through mode to allow the same mon-
    itor to be used by both the 8514A and the VGA.


    2.3.3.2  I/O Addresses

    All access to the 8514A is through I/O registers.  None of its
    display memory is mapped into the CPU's memory address space.
    The color palette registers (called DACs) are similar to those on
    a VGA.  These registers respond to the VGA DAC's I/O addresses
    when the 8514A is in VGA  pass-through mode.  This allows the
    color palette registers to shadow changes made to the contents of
    the VGA DACs.  In 8514A mode, however, the registers respond to
    their own I/O addresses and are completely independent from the
    VGA DACs.

    2.4  VGA grafinfo File Note

    While this EFS provides a new set of grafinfo files, there may be
    situations where it makes more sense to continue using your
    current grafinfo file.  For example, if you customized your
    grafinfo file, you may not want to spend the time translating
    your changes to the new grafinfo file.

    It is important to note, however, that grafinfo files that worked
    with X servers prior to Xsight 2.3 do not work with the 2.3
    server unless the DEVTECH field for VGA adapters is changed from
    a value of 2 to a hexadecimal value of 0x0D.

    The DEVTECH field is a bit-masked value that describes the
    features of the device display.  For example, 0x0D indicates that
    the graphics adapter is for a VGA, flat, linear display.

    You can determine if the correct value is set by examining the
    file in the respective vendor's directory subordinate to the
    /usr/lib/grafinfo directory.  Use an editing utility such as
    vi(C).  Search for the DEVTECH field and ensure that the field is
    correct.  The possible values for this field are:

       0x0001              =       Monochrome, flat, interleaved
       0x0002              =       Monochrome, bank-switched, linear
       0x0003              =       Monochrome, bank-switched, interleaved
       0x0004              =       Multibit, flat, linear
       0x0005              =       Multibit, flat, interleaved
       0x0006              =       Multibit, bank-switched, linear
       0x0007              =       Multibit, bank-switched, interleaved
       0x0008              =       Multiplane, flat, linear
       0x0009              =       Multiplane, flat, interleaved
       0x000A              =       Multiplane, bank-switched, linear

       0x000D              =       VGA, flat, linear
       0x000E              =       VGA, bank-switched, linear
       0x000F              =       VGA, segmented, linear
       0x0010              =       TMS 34010, rowBytes, powers of 2
       0x0011              =       TMS 34010, rowBytes, variable

   2.5  International Keyboard Support

   Support is provided in this EFS for international
   keyboard mapping. The following features are provided:

      o an xterm binary for running character-based terminal programs
        under Xsight using a VT100 or tek4014 emulation mode

      o keymap files for language support for US, French, German,
        Italian, Spanish, and United Kingdom keyboards.  Additional
        information describes how to enhance a keymap file to add new
        modifiers and specialized key symbols for other regional
        languages.

      o an XKeyBind object module providing international key binding
        to C programs.  This module is supplied in both the OMF and
        COFF formats, for the XENIX operating system and the UNIX
        operating systems, respectively.

    mat:

            xmodmap  /usr/lib/X11/keymaps/keymap-file

    This call can be placed in your .startxrc file or executed any
    time after the Xsight server is loaded.

         XTerm*terminal-type*boldfont: bold-font-name

    For example, for a VT100 terminal type specifying 14-point Courier
    type, the lines are:

         Xterm*vt100*font: \
         -adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--14-100-100-100-m-90-iso8859-1

        Always specify constant width fonts; proportional fonts are not
        displayed correctly.

    2.5.2  Using the New xterm Binary

    The new xterm binary supplied with this release has been enhanced with
    the addition of the -I option for international keyboard usage.  When
    this option is not specified, pressing the <Alt> key and another key
    causes an <Esc> character to be inserted before the other key value.
    When the -I option is specified, no <Esc> character is inserted; how-
    ever, the key that is emitted can be specified in the keymap file.


    *********************************************************************

    NOTE

        You may find the Motif window manager captures keystrokes before
        the keymap interprets a value.  For example, if you specify an 
        <Alt> key as a modifier, and then assign a value to <Alt> 4, when 
        this key string is entered, the current window closes without 
        warning.  Ensure that you do not use these key sequences with the 
        Motif window manager:

                       <Alt> 4   <Alt> 8   <Alt> -
                       <Alt> 5   <Alt> 9   <Alt> =
                       <Alt> 7   <Alt> 0   <Alt> <Esc>

    *********************************************************************


    2.5.3  Making a New XLib

    The XKeyBind.o file provided in this release requires the use of the
    Xsight Development System.

    The XLookupString routine in XLib has been changed for this release to
    take into account all modifier keys that are enabled for the selected
    keymap.  Previously, only the shifted case was handled.

    If you are creating X clients that need this feature, replace the
    XKeyBind.o in both the libX.a and SlibX.a library files.  Follow these
    commands to make the module replacement:

     1.  Log in as root.

     2.  Execute these commands:

         Refer to the ``Programmer's Reference'' manual for more information
         about the ar(CP) and ranlib(CP) utilities.


    2.5.4  Enhancing a Keymap

    The Keymap files that are located in /usr/lib/X11/keymaps allow X
    programs that have been compiled with the XKeyBind.o module, such
    as the new xterm -I provided by this EFS, to utilize extended key
    combinations supported by international keyboards.  The Keymap
    files provide the necessary mechanism for mapping modified keys
    to unique character symbols (keysyms).

    To enhance the functionality of a keymap, you can use the XLook-
    upString routine that is part of the XKeyBind module so that up
    to five modifiers can be added to a keymap.  A modifier is a key
    that, when pressed, causes the next key entered to generate a
    character.  For example, you can specify that the left <Alt> key
    be a modifier.

    The following guidelines should be followed when enhancing a key-
    map:

     1.  Plan the layout of the keys that you wish to add.  Ensure
         with a usability study that access to the keys meets the
         needs of your users.










    Release Information                                                  2-19



     2.  Examine a keymap file that contains modifier keys.  Keymap
         files are in the /usr/lib/X11/keymaps directory.  The
         kmap.ge file in this directory, for example, contains modif-
         ier keys that produce characters available on a German key-
         board.

         The format for a keymap is:

	 keycode value = base_keysym  shift_keysym  Mod1_keysym, Mod2_keysym...

         The keycode designator indicates that the described key
         entry is enabled.  You can disable keys by prefacing the
         designator with an exclamation sign (!), as in !keycode.
         The exclamation sign makes the key entry a comment.

         The value field is a hexadecimal keycode number ranging from
         0 to whatever range of values that the keyboard can gen-
         erate.  This field must not be altered when enhancing a key-
         map.

         The base_keysym is the unshifted value of the key, and gen-
         erally indicates the legend that is printed on the key.  The
         shift_keysym is the shifted value of the key.

    *********************************************************************

    NOTE

        The base_keysym and shift_keysym values should never be modified,
        as they determine your keyboard layout.

    *********************************************************************


         Mod1_keysym is the first of up to five possible columns of
         modifier keys.  The first modifier is typically the <Alt>
         key.  Columns are separated by spaces.  Modifier keys are
         added with the add command, which is described in the next
         section.

















    2-20             SCO Xsight 2.3 Server EFS Release and Installation Notes



    ***********************************************************************

    NOTE

        The /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h file is useful for choosing new
        keysym names.  This file is provided with the Xsight Development
        System and contains definitions for each possible key symbol, 
        called keysyms in the keymap file format.  Each definition is pre-
        faced with the string XK_, which you should omit when entering a 
        key symbol in a keymap file.  For example, BackSpace is defined as 
        XK_BackSpace in the keysymdef.h file.  Before adding a key symbol, 
        ensure that your selected font can generate such a symbol.

    ***********************************************************************


     3.  Execute the /usr/bin/X11/xmodmap utility with the -help and
         -grammar options to familiarize yourself with the informa-
         tion in these screens.  The xmodmap utility lets you proto-
         type key symbols into the current server keymap before com-
         mitting the changes into a keymap file.  Refer to the
         xmodmap(X) manual page for more information.

     4.  Use the information in the next section to enhance a keymap.


    2.5.5  Adding Key Symbols to a Keymap

    You can add key symbols either by entering the key symbol in a
    keymap file, or by using the xmodmap(X) utility.  Use the xmodmap
    -grammar command to list the possible keymap commands that can be
    added.  To prototype a command, use the xmodmap -e command.  Note
    that any changes made with xmodmap are lost when the server
    exits; therefore, commit changes to a keymap file or store the
    changes in either the /usr/lib/X11/sys.startxrc file or in the
    .startxrc file in each user's home directory.  Use xmodmap
    without arguments to list the current status for the X server.

    For example, you can designate the first modifier as accepting
    input from both <Alt> keys with this command:

            xmodmap -e "add Mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R"














    Release Information                                                  2-21



    When you are ready to place the command in the keymap file,
    insert the add command at the top of the keymap file using an
    editor such as vi(C).  In the keymap file, the command appears
    like this:

            add Mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R

    Then insert key symbols in the first modifier column (shown as
    Mod1_keysym in the previously described keymap file format).
    Remember that some <Alt> key values, such as <Alt> 4 have special
    meaning to the window manager, so do not assign key symbols to
    those fields.

    Another example of changing modifiers is that you might want to
    designate each <Alt> key as a different modifier.  To achieve
    this, use:

            xmodmap -e "add Mod1 = Alt_L"
            xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Alt_R"

    Again, adding modifiers does not have effect unless key symbols
    are added to the modifier columns in the keymap file.  You can
    add values from xmodmap -e by using the keycode command.

    For example, to add key symbols to each modifier column for the
    ``u'' key in the kmap.ge keymap to accompany the previous example
    of designating the first two modifiers as being the left and
    right <Alt> keys, use this command:

            xmodmap -e "keycode 0x1d = u U braceright braceleft"

    This command indicates that the U key on the German keyboard gen-
    erates u unshifted, U when shifted, ] when the left <Alt> key is
    pressed followed by the U key, and finally [ when the right <Alt>
    key is pressed followed by the U key.

    Manual Graphics Adapter Configuration  A-2
         Graphics Adapter Card Designation  A-3


















































    A.1  Introduction

    This appendix explains how to configure a graphics adapter manually
    for use on a XENIX system by editing the /usr/lib/grafinfo/grafinfo.def 
    file.  Additionally, this appendix provides a table that lists all of 
    the supported graphics adapters, the supported modes of resolution for 
    each adapter, and the entry you need to make in grafinfo.def for each 
    combination of adapter type and adapter mode.


    ***********************************************************************

    NOTE

        The grafinfo files that worked with X servers prior to Xsight 
        release 2.3 do not work with the 2.3 server unless the DEVTECH 
        field for VGA adapters contains the correct value.  If your system 
        contains grafinfo files that were not shipped with this release, 
        refer to ``VGA grafinfo File Note'' section in Chapter 2 for more 
        information.

    A.2  Manual Graphics Adapter Configuration

    If you are using a XENIX system, the new graphics adapter support pro-
    vided by this EFS will not be apparent from the list of adapters
    displayed in the video configuration portion of the installation.  If
    your adapter type is not displayed during the installation, but it is
    listed in Table A.1, ``Graphics Adapter Card Designations,'' at the
    end of this section, you can configure your system to use your graph-
    ics card, but you need to perform this configuration manually.

    The information about the type of graphics adapter in your computer
    and the mode of resolution it is using is stored in a file called
    grafinfo.def, located in /usr/lib/grafinfo.  This is the file that you
    must edit to configure your adapter for use.

    You supply the grafinfo.def file with the information your system
    needs in a grafinfo.def entry.  The format of this entry is very
    specific and comprised of the following pieces of information:

         vendor.model.class.mode-colors

                   or

         vendor.model.class.mode-colors-comment


    For example, the grafinfo.def entry for the Video Seven VEGA graphics
    adapter is:

         video7.vega.ega.640x350-16


    The video7, vega, and ega information in the entry signifies the
    manufacturer of the card, the model or type of card, and the card's
    class, respectively.  The 640x350-16 information signifies the mode,
    or resolution, and the number of simultaneous colors, available from
    the card.  The first number (640) is the horizontal screen measurement
    in pixels, the second number (350) is the vertical screen measurement
    in pixels, and the third number (16) is the maximum number of colors
    that can be simultaneously displayed.
















    A-2              SCO Xsight 2.3 Server EFS Release and Installation Notes



    Other pieces of information that you might find in an entry include
    the @ symbol followed by a value.  This value represents the speed of
    the system clock in megahertz.   However, the speed value may be
    represented in the comment field; for example, on the ATI VGA 72 HZ
    adapter, the clock speed is specified with the -72 value.  If a -I
    appears at the end of an entry, the image is interleaved.

    The grafinfo.def entry is in all lowercase characters and the file can
    only contain one entry.

    Table A.1, ``Graphics Adapter Card Designations,'' in the following
    section, lists the grafinfo.def entries for all of the supported
    graphics adapters. Locate the entry for your particular adapter and
    then perform the following procedure to configure the card for your
    system:

      1.  Log in as root.

      2.  Edit /usr/lib/grafinfo/grafinfo.def using a text editor such as
          vi(C).  Enter the grafinfo.def entry that relates to your graph-
          ics adapter and desired mode of operation.  Replace any existing
          entry with this new information; this file can contain only one
          line.

      3.  Write and exit the file.


    A.2.1  Graphics Adapter Card Designation

    Table A.1 provides three pieces of information:  all of the graphics
    adapter cards that are supported for use with the server, all of the
    modes of resolution that are supported for a particular adapter, and
    the grafinfo.def entry for every combination of adapter type and
    adapter mode.  The graphics adapters are listed in alphabetical order.

    If you are using the XENIX system, your card is supported if it is
    listed in this table, regardless of whether or not the adapter is
    displayed during the video configuration part of the
    SCO Xsight 2.3 Server EFS installation.

    If you are using the SCO UNIX System V operating system or Open Desk-
    top, check this table to verify that your graphics adapter and the
    mode of resolution you want to use is supported.
