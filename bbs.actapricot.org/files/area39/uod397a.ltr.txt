Dear SCO Customer,

The enclosed Support Level Supplement (SLS) UOD397A contains a new kernel 
module that corrects a problem where creation of multiple large shared memory
segments greater than slightly less than 4MB is not possible.

This SLS applies to these SCO UNIX Version 4.2 based operating systems:

        SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.2

        SCO Open Server 3.0 Product Family:

                SCO Open Desktop Lite Release 3.0
                SCO Open Desktop Release 3.0
                SCO Open Server Network System Release 3.0
                SCO Open Server Enterprise System Release 3.0


Using custom(ADM) to install SLS UOD397A
________________________________________

1.  If the system is running in multiuser mode, log in as root on the console.
    After warning the users that the system will be down for some time, enter
    the command:

        shutdown  -y -g0 su

2.  When the system enters single-user mode, you will see the message:

        Type CONTROL-d to proceed with normal startup,
        (or give root password for System Maintenance):

    Enter the root password and press <Enter>.
    Wait until the "#" prompt appears.

3.  Next, insert the custom volume diskette labeled "Nopen SLS
    Custom Install Disk" in the floppy drive and enter the command:

        /etc/custom

    The custom menu will appear.

4.  To select the following, highlight each one with the cursor keys 
    and press <Enter>:

        Install -> A New Product -> Entire Product

   - Position the cursor so that "Install" is highlighted and 
     press <Enter>.

   - Make sure that the words "A New Product" are highlighted in the window 
     found in the lower right-hand corner of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - Make sure the words "Entire Product" are highlighted in the "Choose an
     option" section of the screen; press <Enter>.

   - You will be prompted to "Insert distribution Volume 1 and press <Enter>".
     Make sure the diskette is already in the drive and press <Enter>

   - You will see the following messages:

   - The message "Saving files about to be Replaced" will flash on the screen.
     You will be prompted to "Insert the requested Volume and press <Enter>".
     The diskette is already in the drive, therefore press <Enter>.

   - You will see the following message:

       Extracting Files

   - When asked if you wish to relink the kernel, reply "Y" in order to insure
     that the modifications from SLS UOD397A are included in the kernel.

     Answer "y" when asked if you want the kernel to boot by default. 

     Answer "y" when asked if you want the kernel environment rebuilt.

   - You will then be prompted to "Press any key to continue"; press <Enter>.

   - At the main custom menu, move the highlighted entry to "Quit" and press
     <Enter>.  Press <Enter> again on the highlighted "yes."
     
   - Reboot the computer.

   - SLS UOD397A is now successfully installed.
