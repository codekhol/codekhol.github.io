Top Issues - August 1993

These are the most frequently asked questions of Novell's Advanced Technical
Support Engineers.


Q:   Why does the following message appear when logging in?

          Your current context is <xxxxx.xxxxx>.  The user specified does not
          exist in this context.  Login will try to find the user in the
          server context.

A:   This message is displayed when login cannot find your user name in the
     current context or the bindery context.  To resolve the problem, specify
     the full name of the user when logging in (login
     server/.cn=admin.o=novell) or specify the context in the NET.CFG file. 
     To specify the context in the NET.CFG, add the following line under the
     "NetWare DOS Requester" section:

          NAME CONTEXT="OU=xxx.OU=xxx.O=xxx


Q:   Why am I getting "File Server Could Not Be Found" errors and how can I
     fix the problem?

A:   Several resolutions to this problem are listed below:

     1.   The latest versions of the MLID drivers (such as NE2000.COM) default
          to frame type Ethernet_802.2.  If you are using Ethernet_802.3 on
          the server, change the frame type in the "Link Driver" section of
          the NET.CFG (located by default in C:\NWCLIENT) to Ethernet_802.3.

     2.   If both the Ethernet_802.2 and Ethernet_802.3 frame types are
          defined in the "Link Driver" section of NET.CFG, make sure that
          Ethernet_802.3 appears first.

     3.   Do not quit the INSTALL before installing Directory Services because
          the server will not advertise itself and you cannot attach or log in
          to the network.  To determine if Directory Services is installed,
          use the following steps:
          
          a.   Load INSTALL.NLM from the file server console.

          b.   Select the "MAINTENANCE/SELECTIVE INSTALL" option from the Main
               menu.

          c.   Select the "DIRECTORY OPTIONS" from the Maintenance menu.

          d.   Select the "INSTALL DIRECTORY SERVICES ONTO THIS SERVER"
               option.

          e.   If Directory Services is installed, the following message is
               displayed:  "This server already contains Directory Services
               Information..."

               If this message is not displayed, Directory Services is not
               installed.  Continue from this point to install Directory
               Services.

               If there is only one NetWare 4.0 server, type DISPLAY SERVERS
               at the console prompt to check for the server name and tree
               name.  If Directory Services is not installed, these names will
               not appear. 


Q:   Loading the disk driver while installing NetWare 4.0 causes the server to
     hang.  Why?

A:   This happens if the hard drive and CD-ROM are on the same SCSI
     controller, because when the NetWare driver is loaded, it overrides the
     DOS driver; therefore, the CD-ROM is no longer recognized as a DOS
     device.  The Release Notes discuss further how to resolve this problem. 


Q:   Where is the System Login Script?

A:   NetWare 4.x does not have a system login script.  The "equivalent" is the
     Container login script; however, the container script only applies to
     users in that container.  The system login script remains on the server
     after an upgrade and may still be used by bindery emulation users.

     Note:  If all three login scripts are present, they execute in the
     following order: Container, Profile, User (CPU).


Q:   How can I set up Windows to run with VLMs on the network?

A:   1:   Install the DOS Requester on a workstation, specifying YES for
          Windows support.  Specify the user's personal WINDOWS directory as
          the path to install Windows support.

     2:   Copy the following files from the user's personal WINDOWS\SYSTEM
          directory to network Windows root directory:

                    VNETWARE.386
                    VIPX.386
                    NETWARE.DRV
                    NETWARE.HLP
                    NWPOPUP.EXE
     
     3:   Create a "NLS" subdirectory under the network Windows directory. 
          Copy all the files and subdirectories from the user's personal
          WINDOWS\NLS directory into the NLS directory.

          Note:  After this is completed, all users on the network must use
          the VLMs.  If NETX must be used, use the following the instructions:

          a.   Create a subdirectory under the network Windows directory.

          b.   Copy VIPX.386 and VNETWARE.386 from WINUP7.ZIP  into the
               subdirectory created above.  WINUP7.ZIP is available from your
               Novell Authorized Service Center (NASC), Novell Reseller, or
               from one of Novell's electronic distribution tools (for
               example, NetWire on CompuServe or the Network Support
               Encyclopedia on CD-ROM).

          c.   Edit each workstation's SYSTEM.INI (386 Enh Section) to reflect
               the new path for VNETWARE.386, VIPX.386, and NETWARE.DRV.  For
               example, if the subdirectory was named NEW, the following
               example shows the syntax to add the path for the new files to
               the 386 Enhanced section of the SYSTEM.INI:

                    network=*f:\windows\new\vnetbios,f:\window\new\
                    vnetware.386,f:\windows\new\vipx.386

                    This allows the NetWare 3.11 virtual drivers to be used
                    instead of the NetWare 4.0 drivers.


Q:   I received the following error when trying to mount a CD-ROM volume:

          Unable to locate user group supervisor access read only error

     After several seconds, the volume starts mounting then a lot of errors
     (about 100) are displayed and the file server beeps.  However, the volume
     eventually mounts.  What do all the errors mean?

A:   This is a cosmetic problem (performance is not effected), and Novell is
     working on a solution.  When NetWare mounts a volume it writes to the
     device.  The errors occur before the driver checks if it is a READ ONLY
     device.  When the driver finally verifies that it is a READ ONLY device,
     NetWAre creates a dummy file on the SYS: volume, writes to that file,
     then mounts the volume.


Q:   How can I backup Directory Services?

A:   You must use an SMS compliant backup application; and currently, SBACKUP
     is the only certified option.  To backup Directory Services, load SBACKUP
     and TSA_NDS at the file server console.  Select "Backup the Directory
     Services" option--any other option will not back up the Directory
     Services.

     Other vendors are developing SMS compliant solutions; however, SBACKUP is
     currently the only certified choice.


Q:   How do I prevent the default login script from executing?

A:   Add the statement NO_DEFAULT in the profile or container script. 
     Creating a user login script will also resolve this issue.


Q:   What is the correct syntax for NWXTRACT?

A:   If the D: drive is the CD-ROM, and C:\DIR is the directory you want to
     copy the files to, use the following syntax:
 
     In NetWare 4.0, do the following:

          Type the following from the C:\DIR directory:

                    d:nwxtract d: <filename/group> /t=<type> 

          where type is items such as ser (server), dos (dos files), os2, or
          win. 
 
     In NetWare 4.01, do the following: 

     1.   Change directories to D:\NetWare.40\English\________ (8
          underscores).
 
     2.   Change directories on C: to the destination directory.
 
     3.   From the destination directory (C:\DIR), type the following:

                    D:nwx_dos D: <filename/group> /t=<type>


Q:   Where is TAPEDAI located?  

A:   TAPEDAI.DSK is not copied off the CD-ROM during installation unless it is
     selected as a disk driver.  If the installation is already complete, use
     NWXTRACT to copy it from the CD-ROM.  The TAPEDAI.DSK from the NetWare
     4.01 CD-ROM is the best to use because it includes a generic driver.

     If the D: drive is the CD-ROM, and C:\DIR is the directory you want to
     copy the files to, use the following syntax:

     In NetWare 4.0, do the following:

          Type the following from the C:\DIR directory:

                    d:\nwxtract d: tapedai /t=ser

     In NetWare 4.01, do the following: 

          1.   Change directories to D:\NetWare.40\English\
                    ________ (8 underscores).
 
          2.   Change directories on C: to the destination directory.
 
          3.   From the destination directory (C:\DIR), type the following:

                         D:nwx_dos D: tapedai /t=ser

     
Q:   Why does the old file server name show up even though I changed the name?

A:   Do not change the name or the internal IPX number in NetWare 4.0.  If you
     have changed it, change it back.  This can, however, be done in NetWare
     4.01 without any problems.


Q:   How can I prevent the following error message from appearing five times
     when I log in to the network?

          Attempting to Authenticate

A:   Add the statement below in the NET.CFG under the "NETWARE DOS REQUESTER"
     section

          LOAD CONN TABLE LOW=ON


Q:   If the drive holding the master replica of a partition dies, how can I
     change another replica of the partition to master?

A:   Use this option only when absolutely necessary because information can be
     lost if the new master was not yet synchronized to the old master.

     Use the following steps to change the master partition:

     1.   At the file server console type the following:

                    LOAD DSREPAIR

     2.   Select "1 Select Options."

     3.   Toggle option 4 to "Repair replica ring with no master."

     4.   Press 8, "Return to selection menu," and select option 2 "Begin
          Repair."

     Select the partition to change as the repair runs.


Q:   Why am I getting errors when executing a capture statement in the login
     script?

A:   The LOGIN.EXE and CAPTURE.EXE in NetWare 4.x require more memory than in
     previous versions of NetWare.  If LOGIN.EXE and CAPTURE.EXE are loaded
     simultaneously, the workstation will run out of memory.  To resolve this
     issue, exit to a batch file that runs CAPTURE, or run CAPTURE from the
     command line after logging in to the network.


Q:   When executing commands such as NETADMIN or CX, I receive errors similar
     to the following:

          You are not logged into Directory Services

     What could be causing this?

A:   The VLMs are not loaded, or you are logged in as a bindery-emulation
     user.  


Q:   Can I use SYSCON to administer my NetWare 4.0 server?

A:   Yes, SYSCON must be used to administer bindery-emulation users.  NETADMIN
     (for DOS) and NWADMIN (for Windows) have replace SYSCON in NetWare 4.0,
     and must be used to administer NetWare 4.0 users.


Q:   When will NetWare 4.01 be available and how do I get it?

A:   NetWare 4.01 officially shipped on July 23, 1993, and all registered
     NetWare 4.0 users were sent a free upgrade on August 16, 1993.  To
     register NetWare 4.0, select the register option in INSTALL (at the end
     of the installation or by loading INSTALL.NLM).  To register NetWare 4.0
     without installing first, call 1-800-NETWARE and press 6 as soon as the
     recording starts.  Then select document 1463 for the applicable
     documents.


Q:   Why doesn't PUPGRADE work after an Across-The-Wire migrate?

A:   The binderies are not transferred during an Across-The-Wire migrate, and
     PUPGRADE needs to access the binderies.  PUPGRADE will, however, work
     after an upgrade using INSTALL because the binderies are already on the
     drive.


Q:   How can I change the license on my server?

A:   1.   From the server console, type the following:

                    INSTALL -R

     2.   Select the "Maintenance/Selective Install" option.

     3.   Select the "License Option" option.

     The -R parameter allows you to remove the previous license and replace it
     with a new license.  The -R is not required when upgrading the number of
     users. 


Q:   Can I have NetWare 4.0 and 4.01 servers in the same tree?

A:   Yes you can have NetWare 4.0 and 4.01 servers in the same tree; however,
     the NDS communications changed between NetWare 4.0 and 4.01, so the
     servers cannot synchronize the Directory Services data.  Novell
     recommends that all servers be upgraded to NetWare 4.01.


Q:   How can a CD-ROM be mounted?

A:   1.   Load the driver for the controller

     2.   Load the ASPI layer unless it is loaded automatically by the driver.

     3.   Load CDNASPI.DSK (generic) or ASPICD.DSK (for Adaptec).

     4.   Load CDROM.NLM.

     5.   From the file server console, type the following:

                    CD MOUNT <Volume name> or <device number>


Q:   Can a CD-ROM device attached to the serial port be mounted?

A:   The CDROM.NLM will work with any device that can register itself as a
     NetWare device.  If NetWare drivers were available for the serial port,
     CDROM.NLM would work.  Currently, however, SCSI devices are the only
     devices with drivers.


Q:   Does the "CD-ROM Products Tested with NetWare 4.0" table in the Release
     Notes list supported and certified CD-ROM devices?

A:   No, there have be no CD-ROM devices certified.  This table contains a
     list of CD devices used while certifying the listed adapters to make sure
     a CD volume could be mounted with the adapter.  No CD-ROMs listed are
     guaranteed to work.

     Note:  This list was removed from the NetWare 4.01 Release Notes.


Q:   The NLIST general help screen is displayed every time NLIST is executed. 
     How can I fix this?

A:   Add the timezone parameter (TZ=xxxx) to the login script or AUTOEXEC.BAT
     (TZ=PST8 for example).  Verify that the Time server type at the server is
     set properly (for example, do not set a single-server tree to primary or
     secondary).


Q:   What is the best way to protect my Directory Services database?

A:   Keep at least two replicas of each partition.  If only one server is in
     the tree, make sure current backups are kept with an SMS compliant
     backup.


Q:   I am receiving the following two errors:

          Wrong version of IBM$RUN.OVL

          Unable to find file textutil.msg

     How can I resolve this?

A:   Set the following parameters in the CONFIG.SYS:

          files=50 (minimum)
          buffers=30 (minimum)


Q:   Why don't the drive mappings work when logging in to a non-NetWare 4.0
     server?

A:   If you attach to a NetWare 4.0 server then log in to another server, the
server name must be included in the MAP statements in the login script. 
Otherwise, it defaults to mapping to the NetWare 4.0 server.


Q:   Why does CX let me change to unavailable contexts before logging in to
     the network?

A:   This is a problem in NetWare 4.0.  The version of CX.EXE that ships with
     NetWare 4.01 fixes this problem.


Q:   What are the Time server types (single, secondary, primary, or
     reference)?

A:   A SECONDARY TIME SERVER obtains the time from a Single Reference,
     Reference, or Primary time server.  One of these types must be present
     for a secondary server.

     A PRIMARY TIME SERVER synchronizes network time with at least one other
     primary server and provides time to Secondary time servers and clients. 
     Do not set up a single server as a primary server.

     A REFERENCE TIME SERVER provides time to which all other servers and
     clients synchronize.

     A SINGLE REFERENCE TIME SERVER provides time to secondary time servers
     and clients.  Set single servers to this time server.

     For more information, see the April 93 application notes, Planning a
     NetWare 4.0 Directory Tree.


Q:   Where can I find the DSMERGE file described in the Release Notes?

A:   The release notes are incorrect because the file is not yet available.


Q:   Because NetWare 4.0 does not have an attach command, how can I attach to
     a NetWare 2.x or 3.x server or a server not in my tree?

A:   Use login /ns <server_name>/<user_name>.  ATTACH can be used from within
     a NetWare 4.0 login script, or ATTACH.EXE can be used by copying it from
     a NetWare 3.11 server.


Q:   During the installation of NetWare 4.0, my server hung.  How can I
     continue where I left off?

A:   If the files were copied to C:\SERVER.40, load SERVER -NS at the server
     console, then load INSTALL to continue the automatic install.  If you
     cannot load SERVER -NS or INSTALL, you must start over with the
     installation.


Q:   Is NPRINTER the same as RPRINTER?

A:   No; however, they are similar.  NPRINTER can specify a specific node that
     is allowed to load NPRINTER, thus preventing other workstations from
     loading it.  Also, the NPRINTER default is polled instead of interrupt
     driven.


Q:   How do I preserve my Directory Services database when upgrading from
     NetWare 4.0 to 4.01?

A:   Select "NO" when prompted to reinstall Directory Services.


Q:   How can I resolve the following error?

          General Protection Fault . . . in module NWIPXSPX.DLL

A:   Load TBMI2.COM and run the WIN/OS2 session in standard mode.  This allows
     applications to run in standard mode and make IPX/SPX calls.  Virtual
     Device Drivers (VxDs) in a WIN/OS2 session are not currently supported
     under IBM OS/2 2.1.  Novell and IBM are working together toward a
     resolution to this issue.  This lack of VxD support causes the error if
     an application runs in enhanced mode and makes IPX/SPX calls.

      
Q:   Do the VLMs work in a VDM (DOS session) under OS/2 2.1?

A:   VLMs will work in a VDM (DOS session) under OS/2 2.1 if a "real" DOS
     kernel (for example, DR DOS 6.0 COMMAND.COM) is used instead of the OS/2
     emulated DOS kernel.  To boot from a real DOS kernel, create a real DOS
     image file and set the DOS_STARTUP_DRIVE in the DOS settings notebook to
     the appropriate drive and path.  For detailed information of how to set
     up a DOS image file, refer to the OS/2 Master Help Index under "DOS,"
     then select "image file, starting from an" option.


Q:   The performance of the NetWare requester for OS/2 2.01 seems slow, and
     the following error messages are displayed:

          REQ0815: The program cannot get the connection ID

          REQ1040: The Requester timed out waiting for reply from server

     How can I improve the performance?

A:   The NetWare requester for OS/2 2.01 drivers default to work in a NetWare
     4.x environment.  When the NetWare 2.01 requester is used in an
     environment without NetWare 4.x file servers, basic requester functions
     such as LOGIN and NetWare Tools take longer than they did under the
     NetWare 2.0 requester.  To resolve this issue, add the statement
     DIRECTORY SERVICES OFF to the NET.CFG file under the "NETWARE REQUESTER"
     heading as follows:

               NETWARE REQUESTER
                     DIRECTORY SERVICES OFF


Q:   What CD-ROM formats does the 4.x CDROM.NLM support?

A:   High Sierra Format and ISO 9660.


Q:   When logged into a NetWare 4.01 server, the following message is
     displayed when I try to map a drive to a NetWare 3.11 server:

          MAP-4.01-430: The following drive mapping operation could not be
          completed. [D:=311TEST\SYS:].1
 
A:   Verify that BIND.VLM and NETX.VLM are contained in the NWCLIENT directory
     on your boot drive.  If BIND.VLM and NETX.VLM are not there, copy them
     into the NWCLIENT directory and reboot the machine.


Q:   How can I read the ElectroText that comes with NetWare 4.x if I am not
     running Windows?

A:   To read the online documentation, you must install Windows on a
     workstation because a DOS based reader is not available.


Q:   Why does my NetWare 4.0 server lock when dismounting a CD-ROM volume?

A:   The Adaptec driver ASPICD.DSK dated 02-22-93 can cause the server to hang
     when a CD-ROM volume is dismounted or causes ABENDS when loaded in the
     STARTUP.NCF.  ASPICD.DSK dated 06-08-93 resolves the issues.  This driver
     is included in the NetWare 4.01 Update, which is being mailed to all
     NetWare 4.0 registered users.


Q:   While installing the NetWare 4.01 CBTs (not the NetWare 4.0 CBTs), the
     following message is displayed:

          Caution!  Int40.ini and NOVINI are pointing to different disk
          drives.  Please notify your System Administrator

     What causes this?

A:   The NOVCBT subdirectory is not created during the installation of this
     CBT.  To correct the problem, use the following steps:

     1.   In the Public directory, rename the "COURSE7" subdirectory to
          "NOVCBT" subdirectory.

     2.   Create a "COURSE7" subdirectory under the "NOVCBT" directory.

     3.   Copy all files from "NOVCBT" to "COURSE7" subdirectory.

     4.   Delete all files from "NOVCBT" subdirectory.

Q:   When binding APPLETLK to the LAN driver, the following error is
     displayed:

          RTMP mismatched range numbers: local=1-5; 46689 reported on  port 1

     There are no other AppleTalk routers on the network.  Why is this error
     occurring?

A:   Although not usually considered AppleTalk routers, some devices, such as
     the Shiva NetModem and Shiva NetSerial, can function as AppleTalk
     routers.  To check for other AppleTalk routers, use the NetWare for
     Macintosh non-seed routing option.  Non-Seed routing is a feature of
     NetWare for Macintosh 3.01 and 3.011, providing the NetWare file servers
     with each AppleTalk network number and zone name of each backbone network
     to which the server is attached.

     To set up the file server as a non-seed router, use the following steps:

     1.   Add the following statement to the AUTOEXEC.NCF:

                    BIND APPLETLK <driver name> net=0-0

     2.   At the server console, type the following

                    Load ATCON

     3.   From the main ATCON menu, select "Router Interfaces" to see if the
          NetWare for Macintosh AppleTalk router "learned" its network
          number/range and zone information from another AppleTalk router
          device.  A network number other than "0" means that some other
          AppleTalk router is on the same cable segment.


Q:   How do I rebuild the desktop of my server volume from my System 7
     Macintosh?

A:   Rebuilding a remote desktop is not a function of Apple's System 7
     Operating System.

     With NetWare for Macintosh 2.x and 3.x, you must rebuild the desktop from
     a System 6.x workstation or a System 7.x workstation booted with a System
     6.x System diskette.

     With NetWare for Macintosh 4.x, the AFP server automatically rebuilds the
     desktop database if the database is corrupt or the database files are not
     present when the volume is mounted and AFP.NLM is loaded.  You can also
     cause a database rebuild using the AFP Console (AFPCON).


Q:   With PSERVER.NLM 1.21 loaded, DOS jobs print fine; and although the queue
     shows up in the Macintosh Chooser, the Macintosh jobs do not print.  How
     can I fix this?

A:   PSERVER.NLM 1.27 (08-12-92) resolves this problem.  This PSERVER.NLM is
     contained in PSERV4.EXE, which is available from your Novell Authorized
     Service Center (NASC), Novell Reseller, or from one of Novell's
     electronic distribution tools (for example, NetWire on CompuServe or the
     Network Support Encyclopedia on CD-ROM).


Q:   The following error was displayed on the server console:

          RTMP Timer - range xx-xx went down

     What does this mean?

A:   This message usually means that a router or server is down, or that
     connection to an entire stretch of the network has been lost.  When
     routers go down, changes in the routing table are not discovered right
     away; instead, routing table entries are aged.  Every entry in the table
     has a validity timer.  If the server does not hear from an internet
     router (such as an Appletalk router or a NetWare server running 3.0x
     NetWare for Macintosh NLMs) and the validity timer for that entry
     expires, the entry goes from suspect to bad.  If the entry's validity
     timer expires two more times, the entry is removed from the Routing Table
     and the error message is generated.

     Check the cabling and Appletalk routers located in the appropriate range.

     On very large AppleTalk networks, these messages can be generated if the
     RTMP packet was not delivered because of traffic.


Q:   I am installing the NetWare for Macintosh VAPs 2.2 on a computer
     configured with NetWare's ROUTER.EXE.  Can I configure this machine for
     AppleTalk routing between the Ethernet and LocalTalk segments?

A:   No, because a PC configured with NetWare's ROUTER.EXE and the NetWare for
     Macintosh 2.2 VAPs only route IPX.  A standalone PC computer can route
     IPX, AppleTalk, or IP with Novell's Multi-Protocol router, a NetWare 3.x
     or 4.x file server, or third-party software or hardware.


COMMUNICATIONS


Q:   The NetWare Access Server intermittently stops processing and flashes
     "Please Wait" for a few minutes.

A:   Netware Access Server periodically checks all enabled ports for an
     initialized modem.  If the modem is not initialized, all of Access
     Server's resources are used trying to initialize it.  If a port is
     enabled without a modem or with a broken modem, Access Server will
     periodically try to initialize it.


PRODUCT INFORMATION


Q:   Can the CBT that is included with NetWare 4.0 be installed on a
     workstation, and is documentation available on how to do it? 
A:   It can be loaded on a workstation but no documentation is provided.


Q:   Is Global MHS 2.0 supported on NetWare 4.0?

A:   It is not currently supported;however, it will be in the near future.


Q:   Does NetWare 4.0 have a MAKEUSER utility equivalent?

A:   Yes, it is UIMPORT.


Q:   Does LANalyzer for Windows 2.0 interpret other protocols?

A:   Yes it does interpret other protocols.  However, it will not decode and
     filter any protocols besides AppleTalk, TCP/IP, and IPX.


Q:   Will Btrieve 6.0 and 6.10 work with NetWare 3.11? 

A:   Yes Btrieve 6.0 work with NetWare 3.11.


Q:   Is LAN WorkGroup compatible with versions of NetWare NFS before 1.2b?

A:   No, because LAN WorkGroup uses a new PKernal; therefore, it will not
     install on a file server that has a version of NetWare NFS earlier than
     1.2b installed.


Q:   Does the NetWare Management Agent 1.5 work with NetWare 4.01? 

A:   Yes it will work.


Q:   Can all 12 function keys be remapped in LAN WorkPlace for DOS with VT220
     emulation?

A:   This question has a two part answer.

     Under DOS, the answer is yes.

     Under Windows, the answer is no because F10 cannot be remapped.


Q:   How many printers are supported when printing from NetWare to Unix with
     NetWare FLeX/IP?

A:   When print from NetWare to Unix with NetWare FLeX/IP, 16 printers are
     supported.


Q:   Does MS-DOS 6.0 work with NetWare SFT III?

A:   Yes MS-DOS 6.0 will work with NetWare SFT III.


Q:   When LAN WorkGroup is installed, do the clients automatically get the
     icons and updates to their system?

A:   No, you must manually run WGSET on each workstation that will need
     services from LAN WorkGroup.


Q:   Do the OS/2 Requesters 1.3 and 2.01 support Search Drive Mappings?

A:   No, OS/2 does not allow modification of the master environment after
     bootup.  Therefore, search drive mappings are not supported.  To resolve
     this problem, make a network drive mapping, then include this drive
     mapping in the path statement.


Q:   How many users can be logged into a NetWare Lite network?

A:   25 users can be logged in at any one time.


Q:   Will LANalyzer for Windows decode NFS?

A:   In the NETWORK NEWS August 1993 edition, it stated that the LANalyzer for
     Windows product would decode NFS.  This is incorrect.  The LANalyzer
     Network Analyzer for Ethernet or Token Ring will decode NFS; however,
     LANalyzer for Windows will not.


NETWARE LITE


Q:   What steps should I follow before calling technical support for a
     resolution?

A:   The list below contains some common troubleshooting ideas for NetWare
     Lite.

     1.   Try duplicating the problem without the NetWare Lite drivers loaded. 
          If the problem occurs without the network loaded, you know the
          problem is not with the network.

     2.   Test the problem from a different node.  If the problem is only
          reproducible on one machine, the problem is probably not a network
          issue.

     3.   If there is a Windows problem, try reproducing it from DOS.  Issues,
          such as printing, that occur in Windows and not in DOS could reflect
          a problem with the Windows setup.

     4.   Strip the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to reduce the
          possibility of a conflicting TSR or device driver.


Q:   After upgrading to MS-DOS 6.0, my machine locks when logging in to the
     network.  Why?

A:   When MS-DOS installs, the SMARTDRV.EXE is loaded by default into the
     CONFIG.SYS or the AUTOEXEC.BAT.

     The following are two reasons why SMARTDRV.EXE will lock the network.

     1.   SMARTDRV.EXE conflicts with NLCACHE (NetWare Lite's cache).  Never
          run two caching programs concurrently.  If NLCACHE is running,
          delete the references to SMARTDRV.EXE in the CONFIG.SYS or the
          AUTOEXEC.BAT.

     2.   On install SMARTDRV is not set up to run on a network.  To use
          SMARTDRV instead of NetWare Lite's NLCACHE, delete the reference to
          NLCACHE in the STARTNET.BAT file, found in the NWLITE directory, or
          in the AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Turn off the advanced writes to the hard drive
          when running SMARTDRV.  To do this edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT statement
          as shown below: For example, if you have a C: and a D: drive, you
          would edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and change the following line:

               C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE

                    to read

               C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE C D


Q:   If I am on a server with a network application installed on it, do I need
     to map a drive to myself to run the network application?

A:   No, you can use the DOS subst command if the application requires that it
     be run from the same drive letter on all machines.  An example of the
     syntax is listed:

          SUBST F: C:\APPS


Q:   When executing a NET LOGIN, an error message returns stating that
     SERVER.EXE does not recognize my user account.  What is causing that
     message?

A:   The newer SMC and NE2000 drivers require a later LSL.COM and IPXODI.COM
     than those shipping with Netware Lite 1.1.  These files are available in
     DOSUP7.ZIP which is available from your Novell Authorized Service Center
     (NASC), Novell Reseller, or from one of Novell's electronic distribution
     tools (for example, NetWire on CompuServe or the Network Support
     Encyclopedia on CD-ROM).  This file is also available on Novell's BBS
     (2400 Baud 408-649-3443/9600 Baud 408-649-3696).


DRDOS


Q:   I can only see one of my two hard drives.  What could be the problem?

A:   DOS cannot find any hard drive that the computer's BIOS does not report
     to DOS.  You must have a BIOS that supports the second hard drive or use
     a SCSI drive that has its own BIOS.


Q:   When booting my machine, I get a message that the A20 line is already
     enabled.  What does this mean?

A:   The A20 handler provides access to the computer's High Memory Area (HMA)
     and is usually not enabled, so HMA is not available on bootup.  The DR
     DOS memory managers EMM386.SYS and HIDOS.SYS activate the A20 handler, so
     the computer's HMA becomes available (this frees up valuable conventional
     memory for your applications to use.)

     Some computers, such as the IBM PS/2, enable the A20 handler; so when the
     DR DOS memory manager tries to do it again, this message is received.  On
     many systems, adding the line /G=PS2 will prevent the message from
     displaying.  The message itself, however, does not mean there is a
     problem.
