SYMPTOM

     When updating the NETWARE.DRV for Virtual Loadable Modules (VLM)
     contained in WINUP9.EXE (v3.02), you may run into the following an error
     after starting Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups 3.11:

     MESSAGE

          Application Error: Call to Undefined Dynalink
          
SOLUTION

     The updated NETWARE.DRV (v3.02) for VLMs contained in WINUP9.EXE now
     requires the NWGDI.DLL file (also found in WINUP9.EXE) to be copied to
     the WINDOWS/SYSTEM directory for both Windows 3.x and WFWG 3.11.

     Note:     The NETX.EXE users are not affected because NETX (shell) uses
               the NETWARE.DRV v2.02 file that does not require the NWGDI.DLL
               file.

     Additional information on this issue can be found for Windows for
     Workgroups 3.11 users in WINVLM.EXE on FTP.NOVELL.COM or NOVFILES on
     CompuServe.

     Solution Specifics:

     Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (WFWG) and VLMs

     Overview:

     Windows for Workgroups 3.11, the latest update from Microsoft, now
     supports ODI drivers using Virtual Loadable Modules (VLMs).  The earlier
     version (3.1) of WFWG only supported monolithic IPX with NETX.EXE (shell)
     using ODINSUP.COM.  In addition, the earlier version (3.1) required
     manual modifications of the configuration files to have both NDIS and IPX
     support.  VLMs were not supported in the WFWG 3.1 environment because of
     several incompatibilities between the two redirectors.

     The current release of WFWG 3.11 no longer requires manual modifications
     of the user's configuration files or the use of ODISUP.COM when using the
     ODI drivers.  This extra step is eliminated when using Microsoft's
     Network Setup and their VXD's (NWLINK.386, NDIS.386, and MSODISUP.386)
     that perform the ODINSUP function.

     Steps:

     The following are some steps to include when updating from Windows 3.x to
     WFWG or from WFWG 3.1 to 3.11 and using the VLMs:

     1.   First, you need to make sure that you have installed the DOS Client
          Kit version 1.1 (VLMs) and include the support for Windows in the
          client install.  (This kit can be obtained by calling
          1-800-UPDATE1.)  If you have previously installed the VLM client kit
          (1.02), make sure you have obtained and applied the latest updates
          from DOSUP9.EXE and WINUP9.EXE from NOVFILES on CompuServe.

     2.   Start the WFWG 3.11 Setup.  When you reach the Network Setup option,
          choose the following: **This example assumes you are using NE2000
          adapter with ODI and NDIS3**

          ===========================================================
          Networks... Microsoft Windows Network (version 3.11)
                     Novell NetWare (Workstation Shell 4.0 and above)
          Drivers....
                    Novell/Anthem NE2000 [ODI/NDIS3]
                    IPX/SPX Compatible transport with NETBIOS
                    Microsoft NETBEUI

          Default  Protocol Set at
          IPX/SPX Compatible transport with NETBIOS

          Driver type [ODI Driver]
          ============================================================

     3.   WFWG 3.11 will now prompt you for the Novell files that you will
          have already installed from the DOS client kit. If WFWG cannot find
          them, give the path to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM and it will find the
          NETWARE.DRV file and other Windows files needed to complete the
          install.

     4.   Now exit to DOS and copy over the NWGDI.DLL from WINUP9.EXE to the
          WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.  This DLL is new and required when using
          NETWARE.DRV 3.02.*

     If these four steps are followed, then WFWG 3.11 will modify and build
     the Windows SYSTEM.INI, WIN.INI, and PROTOCOL.INI. The following DOS
     files will also be modified AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS and NET.CFG.

     *Note: Previously we have stated that the client kit should be installed
     before starting the WFWG update.  However, some users are updating their
     1.02 client kit with DOSUP9.EXE and WINUP9.EXE.  The NetWare Client for
     DOS/Windows Install 1.02 (which shipped with NetWare 4.01, 3.12, and was
     available on CompuServe) and WFWG 3.11 Setup does not copy the NWGDI.DLL
     file. However, the current NetWare Client for DOS/Windows 1.1 does copy
     NWGDI.DLL file to the appropriate location.

     In the WINUP9.TXT file, it states that you should copy the following
     files to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory when using VLMs:

     NETWARE.DRV    v3.02
     NETWARE.HLP    6-17-93
     *** NWGDI.DLL  NetWare Graphical Device Interface (required for
                    NETWARE.DRV v3.02)***

     If the NWGDI.DLL is not found when NETWARE.DRV initailizes, it will
     return the following message:

     MESSAGE

          Application Error: Call to undefined  dynalink.

     Therefore, after installing WFWG 3.11, manually copy the NWGDI.DLL to the
     WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory when using the NETWARE.DRV 3.02 file.

     ========================================================

     Other Windows for Workgroups 3.11 / Novell Issues

     Note:     The AUTOEXEC.BAT file needs to have ODIHLP.EXE (Real Mode stub
               for ODI support that binds NWLINK to the ODI driver) placed
               after the LSL.COM file.  An issue can arise if you are using
               STARTNET.BAT file created by the client install.  If you are
               using the "CALL STARTNET.BAT" command, then you should move
               ODIHLP.EXE file to the STARTNET.BAT file after LSL.COM and
               NE2000.COM lines.

     Note:     NWLINK.386 (32-bit IPX/SPX compatible transport VxD) defaults
               to ETHERNET_802.3 frame type.  In a NetWare 4.01 or 3.12
               environment, the default frame type is ETHERNET_802.2. Running
               RCONSOLE in a DOS box in WFWG will utilize the NWLINK.386 when
               it sends raw SPX packets.  Because it will send ETHERNET_802.3
               frames, no servers will show up on the RCONSOLE server
               available list.  By changing  NWLINK.386 to ETHERNET_802.2
               frames, the problem is resolved.

     Note:     The user was using the 32-file access parameter in Windows for
               Workgroups 3.11 and NETX.  Performance was slow when starting
               Windows applications.  If they turned the 32-bit files access
               off WFWG, the problem went away.  The NETWARE.DRV 11-24-93 file
               that the user was using was for the VLMs instead of the one for
               NETX.  After the user changed to using the NETWARE.DRV 10-27-92
               for NETX found in WINUP9.EXE, the problem was resolved
